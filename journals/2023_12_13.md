	- addresses are passed into a function, `constructMerkleTree`, which sits between the client-side and the contract code. 
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- Following `constructMerkleTree` execution, an instance of an "AirdropCampaign" smart contract in instantiated on agoric's blockchain. During the `startInstance` phase, the root of the tree is passed into the contracts `terms` argument

- Address Verification
  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- The `AirdropCampaign` contract exposes a method, `checkWalletAddress`, which is fixed to the tree root (obtained via `zcf.getTerms()`).

	- users check if their eligible by passing in their wallet address as input to `checkWalletAddress`. This can return a boolean value that is used to display whether or not they are eligible on the UI. If applicable, this can even return an NFT to those who are eligible in, while those who are ineligible
