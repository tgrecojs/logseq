- # Daily Learning Log - January 7, 2025
- ## Vim Basics
  From today's learning about Vim text editor:
  
  1. Vim is a terminal-based text editor
  2. Basic commands learned:
	- Starting Vim: Type `vim` in terminal
	- Entering command mode: Press Shift + colon (`:`)
	- Quitting Vim: Type `:q` in command mode
- ## Key Observations
  1. Vim operates in different modes
  2. Command mode is accessed through the shift + colon combination
  3. Commands can be written in full (like "quit") or abbreviated (like "q")
- ## Course Structure Overview
  The complete Vim course covers:
  
  1. Basic movement and navigation
  2. Different Vim modes
  3. File saving operations
  4. Built-in commands
  5. Command combinations
  6. Copy and paste functionality
  7. Configuration options
  8. Config file management
  9. Plugin system
- ## Follow-up Items
  1. Practice basic Vim commands
  2. Review movement commands in next lesson
  3. Explore different Vim modes
  4. Learn file saving operations
- ## Moving Around
	- # Today's Learning Notes: Vim Navigation
	- ## Basic Vim Movement Commands
	  
	  1. Core navigation keys (home row position):
		- h: Move left one character
		- j: Move down one line
		- k: Move up one line
		- l: Move right one character
		  
		  2. Word navigation:
		- w: Move forward one word
		- b: Move backward one word
	- ## Key Benefits
	  
	  1. Efficiency benefits:
		- Keeps hands on the home row
		- Eliminates need for mouse usage
		- Faster navigation through text
		  
		  2. Ergonomic advantages:
		- Reduces hand movement
		- Minimizes reaching for arrow keys
		- More natural finger positioning
		  
		  This basic movement system forms the foundation for efficient text editing in Vim, emphasizing keyboard-driven navigation over mouse-based interaction.
	- Based on the window content, I'll help document your learning about Vim's different modes from the egghead.io lesson:
	- # Vim Modes Learning Notes - January 7, 2025
	  
	  1. **Core Concept**
		- Vim is a modal editor
		- Each operation requires being in the correct mode
		- Mode status is shown in bottom left corner
		  
		  2. **Main Modes**
		  1. Normal Mode
			- Default starting mode
			- Used for navigation
			- Used for text manipulation
			  
			  2. Command Mode
			- Accessed by pressing Shift + : (colon)
			- Shows prompt at bottom left
			- Used for entering editor commands
			  
			  3. Insert Mode
			- Accessed by pressing 'i'
			- Used for typing/inserting text
			- Exit by pressing Escape key
			  
			  4. Visual Mode
			- Accessed by pressing 'v'
			- Used for selecting text
			- Can select character by character
			- Visual Line Mode (Shift + v) selects entire lines
			  
			  3. **Mode Switching**
			  1. To Normal Mode: Press Escape from any mode
			  2. To Insert Mode: Press 'i'
			  3. To Command Mode: Press Shift + :
			  4. To Visual Mode: Press 'v'
			  5. To Visual Line Mode: Press Shift + V

	- I'll update the documentation with additional Vim commands, particularly focusing on selection, deletion, copying, and pasting operations.
	- # Vim Learning Documentation

	  | `yy` | Copy (yank) entire line | Normal mode |
	  | `yw` | Copy (yank) word | From cursor to end of word |
	  | `y$` | Copy to end of line | From cursor to line end |
	  | `v` | Enter visual mode | Character-wise selection |
	  | `p` | Paste after cursor | Normal mode |
	  | `P` | Paste before cursor | Normal mode |
	  | `x` | Delete character | Under cursor in normal mode |
	  | `D` | Delete to end of line | From cursor position |
	- ## Version Information
	- Current Version: 7.4.1090
	- Developer: Bram Moolenaar et al.
	  id:: 677d5a3a-0f40-4ddf-a030-085df8bf34aa
	- License: Open source and freely distributable
	- ## Selection Tips
	  1. Use `v` for character-wise selection
	  2. Use `V` for line-wise selection
	  3. Use `Ctrl+v` for block selection
	  4. Use `gv` to reselect the last visual selection
	- ## Copy/Paste Tips
	  1. Selections are automatically copied when deleted
	  2. The `"` register stores the last deletion/yank
	  3. Use numbered registers (`"1p`, `"2p`, etc.) to access older copies
	  4. System clipboard can be accessed with `"+` register
	  
	  This documentation will continue to be updated as more commands and patterns

- # VIM Command Learning Notes - January 7, 2025
	- Based on the video content about combining VIM commands, here are the key learnings documented:
	- ## Command Structure
	  VIM commands typically follow a three-part structure:
	  1. Action
	  2. Location
	  3. Context (second location)
	- ## Command Reference Table
	  
	  | Command | Description | Example Use Case |
	  |---------|-------------|-----------------|
	  | `cit` | Change Inner Tag | Deletes content inside HTML tags and enters insert mode |
	  | `ci{` | Change Inner Curly Braces | Deletes content inside curly braces and enters insert mode |
	  | `ci"` | Change Inner Quotes | Deletes content inside quotation marks and enters insert mode |
	  | `dw` | Delete Word | Deletes a word and stays in normal mode |
	  | `cw` | Change Word | Deletes a word and enters insert mode |
	- ## Key Concepts
	  
	  1. VIM treats text as objects that can be manipulated, not just as collections of letters
	  2. Commands can be combined for more powerful editing capabilities
	  3. VIM understands context-aware boundaries (tags, brackets, quotes)
	  4. The system preserves important syntax elements (closing tags, quotes, braces) while manipulating inner content
	- ## Common Patterns
	  
	  1. Using `c` (change) puts you into insert mode after deletion
	  2. Using `d` (delete) keeps you in normal mode after deletion
	  3. The `i` modifier typically refers to "inner" content
	  4. Commands are composable and follow logical patterns
- # VIM Command Learning Documentation
	- Based on the content about VIM copy and paste functionality, here's a documentation of the key commands and their actions:
	  
	  | Command | Action | Description |
	  |---------|---------|-------------|
	  | `v` | Enter Visual Mode | Allows text selection for copying or cutting |
	  | `y` | Yank (Copy) | Copies the selected text in visual mode |
	  | `p` | Put (Paste) | Pastes the previously copied or cut text |
	  | `dd` | Delete Line | Cuts the entire current line (can be pasted later) |
	- ## Additional Notes:
	  
	  1. VIM maintains its own clipboard separate from the system clipboard
	  2. Text copied in VIM cannot be pasted into other applications by default
	  3. The delete command (`dd`) works similarly to cut in other text editors
	  4. Pasting can be done while in normal mode
	  5. Commands can be executed from any position in the line
	- ## Learning Sequence:
	  
	  1. Start by entering visual mode (`v`)
	  2. Select desired text
	  3. Use yank (`y`) to copy
	  4. Move cursor to desired location
	  5. Use put (`p`) to paste
	  6. Alternatively, use `dd` to cut entire lines
	  
	  This documentation will be updated as new commands and patterns are learned throughout the day.
- # Configure Vim
	- | Command/Action | Description | Result |
	  |--------------|-------------|---------|
	  | `Shift + :` | Keyboard shortcut | Enters command mode in VIM |
	  | `syntax on` | Command | Enables syntax highlighting |
	  | `syntax off` | Command | Disables syntax highlighting |
	  | `set number` | Command | Shows absolute line numbers |
	  | `set nonumber` | Command | Disables absolute line numbers |
	  | `set relativenumber` | Command | Shows relative line numbers (distance from current line) |
	  | `set norelativenumber` | Command | Disables relative line numbers |
	  | `set number relativenumber` | Command | Enables both absolute and relative line numbers simultaneously |
	  | `help option-list` | Command | Displays comprehensive list of all available VIM options |
	  
	  **Pattern Notes:**
	- To disable a setting, add `no` prefix to the setting name (e.g., `nonumber`, `norelativenumber`)
	- Commands are entered after entering command mode
	- Settings can be combined in a single command (as shown with number and relativenumber)
	  
	  This table format provides a quick reference for basic VIM configuration commands and their effects on the editor's behavior.
