## ZkOffers
	- The NSA doesn't care about using zero-knowledge because there is enough off-chain data to identify users.
	- ## Nym
	- ### Mixnet
		- prevents traffic analysis
		- Tor
			- Anyone watching your entry and exit traffic can de-anonomyize you
		- Nym
			-
- ### Union
	- IBC-enabled blockchain that uses zk to facilitate transactions between ethereum and ibc blockchains.
	- ### Union Stack
		- ***CometBLS***
			- an improvement upon Tendermint which makes it suitable for zero-knowledge proving.
		- **Galois**
			- The umbrella term of Union's ZK efforts. It currently has one purpose:Â [consensus verification](https://docs.union.build/concepts/consensus-verification). We've built Galois around three fundamental principles:
				- Fast execution
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
				- Low cost
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
				- Decentralized
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- **Voyager**
		- IBC relays on off-chain actors transferring packets and proofs between chains. Voyager is our in-house relayer, allowing us to support new networks without waiting for up-stream support.
