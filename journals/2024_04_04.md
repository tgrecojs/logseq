- Ivan - Why was it easier
	- Great question! The answer is ... shall i say, multifaceted :wink:, actually though. One aspect stems from dealing with types. I've faced some difficulty working with types within agoric dapps. Here is a screenshot of my VSCode failing to give me type information on the `Brand` type, so working with the agoric-sdk allows me to sidestep these issues. This isn't *always* the case. I've enjoyed the expeirence that comes with VSCode suggesting a list of possible types to choose from in response to typing out "ZCF..." (for example). The experience is inconsistent though, so agoric-sdk is the path of least resistance.

	- Another aspect deals with the contract folder's dependencies. There are times when I'll import something into my codebase only to have VSCode complain about the package not being listed as a dependency within my project, despite it being present in the package.json's `dependencies` object.

	- I actually mentioned this to dan connolly in office hours yesterday. He wasn't sure of why this occurred, or how to resolve this, but he acknowledged the existence of this problem.

	- The gist of it is - working directly from within the sdk eliminates  is the standout dev environment

	- I haven't got to the bottom of it although I haven't sunk signficant time making an attempt to,
	- has been times when i've been able to beging typing "ZCF" only to watch VSCode show a list of types to choose from
	- our "Purse" (example) and
	- working with type declarations that exist within the agoric sdk

	- One aspect deals with the ever-changing state of the agoric-sdk
