## #[[TIL Series]] She ba `set -e`
	- Today I finally took a minute out of my day to learn about a text that I often see atop bash files  `set -e` .
	- And so in this TIL series I'm quickly going to explain what set-e is doing.
	- ```sh
	  #!/bin/bash
	  mkdir JavaScript-Design-Patterns
	  cd JavaScript-Design-Patterns
	  npm init -y
	  touch .gitignore
	  git init 
	  echo "node_modules" >> .gitignore
	  ```
	-
	- So when you see set-e above at the top of a bin bash file such as the one below you're instructing bash to exit immediately if any of the commands in this bash file fail to execute. In other words you're telling the bash file to exit immediately if any command returns a non-zero exit status. A non-zero exit status means that the command has failed to execute.
