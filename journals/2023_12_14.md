## #[[TIL Series]] `set -e`
	- Today I finally took a minute out of my day to learn about a text that I often see atop bash files  `set -e` .
	- ###
	- ```sh
	  #!/bin/bash
	  mkdir JavaScript-Design-Patterns
	  cd JavaScript-Design-Patterns
	  npm init -y
	  touch .gitignore
	  git init 
	  echo "node_modules" >> .gitignore
	  ```
	-
	- So when you see set-e above at the top of a bin bash file such as the one below you're instructing bash to exit immediately if any of the commands in this bash file returns a non-zero exit status, thus indicating a failure to execute
	- ### Shebang, shebang!
		- Ok, so now that I finally knew the significance of `set -e`, I fe atop bash files you'll also see the pound sign along with an exclamation point and this precedes bin slash bash. So, again, this was another part of the syntax that I simply accepted without having a true understanding of. Now, however, I can say that this is no longer the case. Okay.
