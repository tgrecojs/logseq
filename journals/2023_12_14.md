## #[[TIL Series]] `set -e`
	- Today I finally took a minute out of my day to learn about a text that I often see atop bash files  `set -e` .
	- ###
	- ```sh
	  #!/bin/bash
	  mkdir JavaScript-Design-Patterns
	  cd JavaScript-Design-Patterns
	  npm init -y
	  touch .gitignore
	  git init 
	  echo "node_modules" >> .gitignore
	  ```
	-
	- So when you see set-e above at the top of a bin bash file such as the one below you're instructing bash to exit immediately if any of the commands in this bash file returns a non-zero exit status, fail to execute.
	- In other words you're telling the bash file to exit immediately if any command returns a non-zero exit status. A non-zero exit status means that the command has failed to execute.
