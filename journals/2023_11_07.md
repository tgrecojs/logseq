## Agoric Discussion
	- My familiarity with "Near" refs comes mainly from erights.org. I've linked to some articles below that helped me get an in-depth grasp on different kinds of references. 
	  
	  I still struggle to come up with concrete examples for "far" and "near" refs in the context of Agoric smart contracting systems (and distributed JavaScript execution in general), so I'm opening this discussion in an effort to get some clarity around the topic.

	- `Far` appears everywhere, but I rarely come across references to "Near" objects in the agoric-sdk. The motivation behind this discussion stems from the makeZoeForTest function shown below, which takes an object containing an optional `useNearRemote` property as its arguments.
	-
	- A search of the agoric-sdk shows just [2 instances of `useNearRemote` being set `true`](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3AAgoric%2Fagoric-sdk%20useNearRemote%3A%20true&type=code), which is quite a small sample size, therefore I'd love to get some more input on how this function is used, when to use it, etc.

	- One other function that I would  `makeLoopback` function seems relevant to this discussions.
