- On Price Authorities
	- Oracle-based liquidation mechanisms are often at the heart of many exploits.
		- Liquidations that occur on a specific expiration date allow us to remove an oracle from liquidations.
	- Price data is essential for making decisions. To think that we wouldn't need to support them would be harmful.
	- must-have for determining max LTV, interest rates, term length, max loan size.
		- Scenarios:
			- A lender wishes to roll-over the money lent out into a new loan (or sets of loans).
			- Borrower wants to automatically repay and close out loan.
				- Price sky rocket causing `collateral = borrows + fees`
				- has a purse with 1/2 of the borrowed, wants to repay when remaining 1/2 is covered by collateral value.
			- a loan that is set to expire
