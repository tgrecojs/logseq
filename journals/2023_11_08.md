- The motivation to open this discussion can be traced back to  the `setupZoeForTest` function shown below. 
  https://github.com/Agoric/agoric-sdk/blob/cd437efa0e2e8438681cc8f5130c5cdecbd9d26a/packages/inter-protocol/test/vaultFactory/test-vault.js#L34-L37
  
  It seems important to have an understanding of how to replicate cross-vat communication so that, upon deployment of a smart contracting system, we can be confident in the ways in which our objects will interact. 
  
  A search of the agoric-sdk shows just [2 instances of `useNearRemote` being set `true`](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3AAgoric%2Fagoric-sdk%20useNearRemote%3A%20true&type=code). This is quite a small sample size, so any input on how this function is used, when to use it, etc. is greatly appreciated! Also, any input on the [usage of `makeLoopback`](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3AAgoric%2Fagoric-sdk%20makeLoopback&type=code) would be really helpful as it seems relevant to the discussion of Near and Far references.
  
  My familiarity with "near" references stems from time spent reading through erights.org, which helped me develop an understanding of the different kinds of references. (I've included links to some of these pages I found particularly helpful.) Still, I struggle to come up with concrete examples for Near references vs. Far references in the context of Agoric smart contracting systems (and distributed JavaScript execution in general), so I'm opening this discussion in an effort to get some clarity around the topic.
