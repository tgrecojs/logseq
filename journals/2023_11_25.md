## Goals
	- turn
-
- ## `+=` vs `++` #[[TIL Series]]
	- I recently took a moment to look into JavaScript's increment/decrement operators  how to increment (and decrement) numbers.
	- Now I had previous experience doing this. But it's nearly impossible to have memorized all of the ins and outs of the JavaScript specification. So I decided to refresh my understanding of these concepts.
	- ### Compound Assignment vs. Increment & Decrement Operators
		- It may not be the most groundbreaking finding, however I was a bit surprised to learn that `+=`  or  `-=` were specific types of operators. They are **compound assignment** operators.
		- It has no impact on the behavior of a program but nonetheless, I thought it pretty amazing that I had gone my entire career and never learned this.
	- ### New Findings in prefix operators
		- The other major finding actually deals with how code behaves  This behavior is a result of using the postfix operator.
		- on the *prefix* and *postfix* operators.
	- ```js
	  let a = 0;
	  let b = a++; // 
	  
	  let c = 0;
	  let d = ++c; // d is 6 and c becomes 6 as well
	  ```
- ## compound assignment operators

- ## Fly.io
	- Don't know shit about it but Kris Kowal mentioned it in the Endo chat.
	- ### Conclusion (Actionables)
		- TODO Get a stronger understanding on how to use Docker / Containers in general.
