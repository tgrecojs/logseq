	- > “It is common in math to give recursive (inductive)  definitions for things.”
	- > In practical terms giving recursive definitions means that we can  progressively compose more complex entities out of simpler objects by applying some  operations between them.
	- ## Algebraic Data Types
	- ### List
		- Definition
			- A list is either....
				- an empty list
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
				- a concatenation of an element and a list.
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Algebraic Definitio

	- ### 3 most pervasive way to combine structures
		- Product Composition
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- Most general object.
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- . The product must be both A and B and must be the  least thing containing both those elements.
		- Coproduct Inheritence
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Recursive Type Inheritence
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- #### Logical AND
		- Concludes that A AND B are correct.
		-
	- ### Pattern Matching
		- A functional way to extract values [out of data types].
		-
	- ### Isomporphism
		- `Id.of(5)` === `Id(5).empty()`
		- Isomorphisms are data types that go to and from one another.
			- `Id.of(5)` === `Id(5)`
		- > Ismorphisms in the case of Functors are called **Natural Transformations**
	- ### Lazy Functors
		- A **thunk** is a subrouting used to inject an addtional calculation into naother subroutine.
			- Primarily used to delay a calculaion until the result is needed,
			- Insert perations at the beginning or end of the end subrouting.
