	- > “It is common in math to give recursive (inductive)  definitions for things.”
	- > In practical terms giving recursive definitions means that we can  progressively compose more complex entities out of simpler objects by applying some  operations between them.
	- ### 3 most pervasive way to combine structures
		- Product Composition
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- Most general object.
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- . The product must be both A and B and must be the  least thing containing both those elements.
		- Coproduct Inheritence
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Recursive Type Inheritence
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
