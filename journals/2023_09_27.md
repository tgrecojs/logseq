### Inter Investigations
	- `makeERecorderKit` vs `makeRecorderKit`
		- `makeRecorderKit` is used primarily.
		- `makeERecorderKit` seems only to be used when creating the (top-level ?) metricsKit.
			- https://github.com/Agoric/agoric-sdk/blob/386dc7cf179bf610841dec4a0b1f55d5d5c50878/packages/inter-protocol/src/vaultFactory/vaultDirector.js#L233
			- `makeERecorderKit` is still passed around quite a bit though?
	- `allManagersDo`
		- Utility function for iterating through a managers facets for the purpose of gaining access to some behaviors.
	- `setOfferFilter`
		- Look into offer filters.
		- From `governance.md`
			- > The Zoe contract framework allows contracts to set filters on what offers they accept, by matching a string in the offer description. The governed contracts above grant to EC the ability to pause the creation of offers by calling `setOfferFilter` to set a list of strings. (Offers are blocked when their 'descriptions are an exact match or a prefix match to one of the strings in the list.  Other criteria are not yet supported](https://github.com/Agoric/agoric-sdk/issues/7317).)
