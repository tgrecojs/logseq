- lockdown has 2 phases
	- 1. taming intrinsics
	- 2. sharing intrinsics are hardened.
- fit well with vetted shims by design.
	- hardened phase seperate from taming.
- proposed
	- repair function
		- takes vetted shim
	- harden is introduced in the repair function.
	- anything hardened between repair and lock is sent to a queue and then locked down in repair.âˆ‚
- order of shims
	- responsible by the library author.
	- some shims can run before lockdown, some can run after lockdown.
- Lockdown
	- `repair` + `hardening`
	- shim runs between the two.
- ### Vetted Shim
	- A piece of code that the host and the guest is vulnerable to.
	- A piece of code that has not been **vetted yet.**
	- must not break the invariants set up by lockdown
	- must not
		- leak any official ambient authority.
		- introduce any shared mutable state.
- ### ZB - package that we don't trust
	- create getter setter pairs
