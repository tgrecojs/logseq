		- ### Merkle Tree Formula #Math
			- #### Sigma Notation a.k.a. Big “E” sign
				- Sigma notation is a concise way of specifying that you are summing up a set of terms
				- Below sigma, `i`, you find the starting index.
				- Above sigma, you find the ending value (not applicable)

				- The formula suggests that you're taking the sum of `hash(node.children(i).hash)` for all values of i within a specified range.
		- ## Construction
			- A merkle tree is a **binary tree**.

			  **H[H(a)||H(b)] and H[H(c)||H(d)]**
			- ## Example Scenario
				- Given the array: ["A","B","C'","D"]
				- We should create a tree with a root equal - **`H[H(a)||H(b)],H[H(c)||H(d)]`**
			- ## Concat
			- Merkle tree construction is simple
				- 1. hash current value in array.
				- 2. concattenate
			- ```js
			  const MerkleTree = (left right, value) => ({
			    left,
			    right,
			    value
			  })
			  ```

			- **Leaf nodes**
			- **Interior Nodes**
			-
			- only have one sibling.
			-
			- We can use that sibling to
