	- `setupZoeForTest`

			- ```js
			  const governorCreatorFacet = E.get(consume.ammKit).governorCreatorFacet;
			  const governorInstance = await instance.consume.ammGovernor;
			  const governorPublicFacet = await E(zoe).getPublicFacet(governorInstance);
			  const governedInstance = E(governorPublicFacet).getGovernedContract();
