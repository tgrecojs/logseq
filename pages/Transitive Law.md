- The transitive law is a property in mathematics that states if two quantities are equal to a third quantity, then they are equal to each other. In formal terms, if a = b and b = c, then a = c.
- Examples of the transitive law:
  1. If 2 + 3 = 5 and 5 = 7 - 2, then 2 + 3 = 7 - 2.
  2. If x + y = 10 and 10 = 5 * 2, then x + y = 5 * 2.
  3. If a² = b² and b² = c², then a² = c².
- These examples illustrate how the transitive law allows us to make deductions and establish relationships between quantities based on their equality to a common value.
