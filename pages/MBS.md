- Mortgage Backed Security
-
- Mortgage becomes a MBS:
	- Alice goes to bank for a mortage.
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- Bank provides Alices with the capital she needs to make the purchase  which is repaid with interest.
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- In addition to the interest rate, Alice and the Bank agree to a payment schedule for partial payments + interest.
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- At this point, the Bank is forced to allocate the full payment amount to Alice, thus eliminating the supply of capital the Bank has accessible. 
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Each time this process occurs, the Bank must again allocate the capital required for the counterparty to fulfill the purchase, and this process can quickly deplete a Bank's supply of capital.
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- *Enter MBS* 
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- The Bank can get the loan off its books and free up capital by selling the stream of interest and principal payments.
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Banks bundle these mortgages with hundreds, thousands of other mortgages.
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Bundle is sold to an investment bank in the form of a single bond.
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- Investment bank partitions the bonds according to quality, which are then sold to investors.
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- Bank keeps loan on books in exchange for the interest. 
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Must keep it "on their books" -> Allocate the capital required for the borrower to purchase the property, thus consuming significant resources as the bank can no longer access this capital.

- ### How Mortgage-Backed Securities Work
	- > The steps to forming a MBS.
	- **Origination**: A financial institution, such as a bank, provides mortgages to homebuyers. These loans are secured by the properties being bought.
	- **Pooling**: The bank and other institutions pool many of these mortgage loans. The loans in the pool typically have similar characteristics, such as interest rates and maturity dates.
	- **Securitization**: The pooled mortgages are sold to a trust, a GSE like Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, a government agency like Ginnie Mae, or a private financial institution. The trust then structures these loans into MBS.
	- **Issuance**: The MBS are issued and sold to investors. The securities are backed by mortgage loans in the pool. In the case of agency MBS, they are further guaranteed by the GSE or government agency, providing additional security to investors.
	- **Servicing**: A mortgage servicer collects monthly mortgage payments from borrowers and distributes these payments to MBS investors. The servicer also handles administrative tasks such as managing escrow accounts and dealing with delinquencies.
	- **Investment**: Investors buy MBS, effectively lending money to homebuyers in the pool. In return, they receive periodic payments, including interest and principal repayments from the underlying mortgages
