## Introduction
	- A central problem of computer science is the integration of knowledge and coordination of action in complex systems.
	- At the broadest level of abstraction, the problems of social and computational coordination are fundamentally similar. Concrete parallels, however, are rough: memory space is a bit like land, or perhaps a raw material; processor time is somewhat like labor, or like fuel; software objects are like workers, or perhaps like managers or firms.
	- #### Transitioning into the digital era
		- Human Markets and Computational Markets
		- Social Coordination
		- > Within a computational system, activities need produce neither pollution nor other effects on non-consenting objects; the most typical product, information, does not form a depletable physical inventory; specialized labor forces (copies of specialized objects) can be expanded almost instantly and can be cut back without human anguish.
	- | Market Types | Traditional | Digital |
	  | --- | --- | --- |
	  |  | Man hours | Processor Time |
	  | Cell 2-1 | number of workers  | number of objects|
	  | Cell 3-1 | Machinery  | Factories |
	  | Cell 4-1 | Cell 4-2 | Cell 4-3 |
	- #### Hypothesis
		- By transitioning to fully digital systems, we can potentially create markets that are orders of magnitude more efficient.
		- system that has no upper bounds
		- the door for markets to improvde Efficiencies stem from transitioning markets to being fully electronic
		- Transitioning markets to digital form can in the creation of a recursive  in markets operating more efficiently
		- effectiveness
