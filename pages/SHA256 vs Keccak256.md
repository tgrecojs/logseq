### Overview
	- SHA256 and Keccak256 are both cryptographic hash functions used for generating digital fingerprints of electronic data.
- ## Sha256
	- Overview:
		- Sha256 has functions produces a 256-bit hash value known as a messsage digest.
	- Output:
		- The 256-bit hash value produced by the sha256 hash function is represented as a **string of [[_red]]==64 hexadecimal== digits**
	- Use cases:
		- Commonly used for:
			- data integrity checks
			- digital signatures, password storage
			- blockchain applications like Bitcoin that require a 256-bit hash.
	- #### Recall Cards
