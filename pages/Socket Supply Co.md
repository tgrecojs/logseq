- ## Problems with Cloud
- Networks get better as peer number increases.
- ### Ubiquitous Computing
- Moving away from the cloud towards edge:
	- Data Proliferation
	- Hardware Proliteration
- The "Edge"
	- Halfstep on the way to P2P.

- ## NAT Traversal
- ICE is an incomplete solution that adds more infrastructure.
- Need to be able to figure out what your information is.
- ### Stage-1
	- Each peer has and needs 2 sockets.
	- The first socket - primary second
	- second - probe secoket
	- Send out a message that says "Im interested in knowing external data about the socket"
		- responds with address and port.
