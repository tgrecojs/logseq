- üìå ‚ÄãDiffie‚ÄìHellman Key Exchange (DHKE) is a cryptographic method to securely exchange cryptographic keys (key agreement protocol) over a public (insecure) channel in a way that overheard communication does not reveal the keys.

  üìù * important property of DKHE to note
      * exchanging keys can take place **"over a public (insecure) channel"**
- üìå Note that the DHKE method is resistant to sniffing attacks (data interception), but it is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks (attacker secretly relays and possibly alters the communication between two parties).

- üìå The Diffie‚ÄìHellman Key Exchange protocol can be implemented using discrete logarithms (the classical DHKE algorithm) or using elliptic-curve cryptography (the ECDH algorithm).

- ### Key Exchange by Mixing Colors
### Part 1
- Alice** and **Bob**, agree on an arbitrary **starting (shared) color** that does not need to be kept secret (e.g. *yellow*).
- Alice** and **Bob** separately select a **secret color** that they keep to themselves (e.g. *red* and *sea green*).
- Finally **Alice** and **Bob** **mix** their secret color together with their mutually shared color. The obtained mixed colors area ready for public exchange (in our case *orange* and *light sky blue*).

### Part 2
- Alice and Bob publicly exchange their mixed colors to create their private mixed color.
