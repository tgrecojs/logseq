## What is an attenuator in the context of an ocap system
	- In the context of an object-capability (ocap) system, an attenuator refers to a mechanism or design pattern that limits or reduces the authority (capabilities) of an object. It is used to restrict the privileges and permissions available to an object, thereby constraining its behavior and reducing the potential for security breaches or unauthorized actions.
	- Attenuators play a crucial role in enforcing the Principle of Least Authority (POLA) in ocap systems. By attenuating the authority of objects, the system ensures that they have only the necessary permissions to perform their intended tasks and no more. This approach helps mitigate the risks associated with code vulnerabilities or malicious actions by minimizing the potential damage that can be caused by compromised objects.
	- Attenuators can be implemented in various ways, depending on the specific ocap system and its requirements. They typically involve techniques such as access control lists, capability revocation, mediation, wrappers, or other forms of authority confinement. The goal is to carefully control and limit the interactions between objects and prevent unauthorized or unintended access to sensitive resources or operations.
