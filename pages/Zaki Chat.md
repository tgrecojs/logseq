- ## Summary
	- ### Technical Issues and Zoom Chat
		- Thomas and Zaki experienced some technical difficulties with Thomas's audio setup. After resolving the issue, they discussed Zaki's recent dental problem where he broke a tooth while eating. Zaki explained the process and his upcoming dental appointment for a replacement, which Thomas commiserated with. Both parties confirmed that their audio and personal issues were resolved satisfactorily.
		- Zoom Discusses 'Slots' Project Importance
		- Zaki discussed his recent re-engagement with a project related to 'slots', which he initially perceived as a minor project for Agoric. However, he realized that the 'slots' turned out to be much more significant than he anticipated, both in terms of their success and their potential for Agoric's future. Zaki shared these insights with Thomas and mentioned that he had been communicating with Bob about these realizations, which had sparked Bob's enthusiasm for the project. Thomas asked for clarification about the community's interest in the project.
	- ### Blockchain Emotional Connection and Engagement
		- Zaki and Thomas discussed the lack of emotional connection in blockchain infrastructure and how it affects user engagement. Zaki pointed out that most blockchain platforms lack an emotional center, making it difficult for users to feel a sense of loyalty or belonging. Thomas agreed, adding that users often see these platforms as mere tools for financial gain, without any emotional ties. They discussed the potential of creating a sense of community through these platforms, citing examples like the civilized discord in the Cosmos ecosystem. They also noted the contrast between this and the sometimes uncivilized nature of Telegram chats.
	- ### Future Plans, Success Factors, and Funding
		- Thomas and Zaki discussed the future plans for their project, emphasizing the importance of continuous development and community engagement. They reflected on the success of their recent launch, attributing its success to the combination of factors such as scarcity, timing, and the right vibes. They also discussed potential future funding sources, including a possible grant to support ongoing development and the potential for a decentralized community funding mechanism. The conversation also touched on the comparison between their project and other popular initiatives like Pooled Together.
	- ### Concerns on Agoric Project Resource Allocation
		- Zoom's Zaki discussed the concerns he had regarding the allocation of resources to the Agoric project, particularly the role of a designer. He expressed uncertainty about whether the project would receive support from the Dcf, and how much they would be willing to invest. Thomas agreed to consider these points. They both acknowledged the hard work put into the project, with Thomas noting the potential for creating reusable libraries and tools for the ecosystem. The social aspect of the project was also hinted at but not elaborated upon.
	- ### Exploring Chat Features for Platform Improvements
		- Thomas expressed his concerns about the lack of a chat feature in their current platform, suggesting the need for a direct messaging system for users to communicate and possibly share financial information. Zaki agreed and mentioned a recent relaunch from their competitor, Fintech, which included features like clubs similar to Telegram and a system called Farming for rewards. Thomas showed interest in exploring these features as potential improvements for their own platform.
	- ### Tokenized Social Platforms and Potential Growth
		- Thomas and Zaki discussed the potential and growth of tokenized social platforms. Zaki expressed his belief that this area holds a significant potential and is a competitive advantage, despite the existing poor quality of some platforms like WorldCoin. Thomas agreed and suggested focusing on non-technical users, considering the potential of these platforms to reach a wider audience. Both agreed on the importance of tokenized social platforms as a potential growth area for the cryptocurrency market.
	- ### DCF Spending, BLD Promotion, and Eigenwal
		- Thomas and Zaki discussed the Dcf's mandate to spend money and the promotion of the Bld in the Agora chain. Zaki shared mixed feelings about the project Tribal, which he started but no longer leads, and the new Eigenwal project. He suggested that the Eigenwal project, if positioned within the Agoric ecosystem, could be a marketing coup and proposed shipping a parody of the Eigen Token called Tribbles. Thomas agreed, seeing it as necessary to draw attention to the ecosystem. Zaki also mentioned a 50K budget and asked Thomas to assign it, promising to try and influence the strategy on the Agoric side.
	- ### DCF Focus on ISD and Community Usage
		- Thomas and Zaki discussed the focus of the Dcf (Decentralized Cooperative Finance) on ISD (Institutional Stable Coin). They agreed that the success of ISD doesn't rely on finance but on community usage. They proposed that the Ist spent in this protocol should be used to support the community, with suggestions including burning it to create a demand sink or using it as locked liquidity in an LP pool. However, they expressed concerns about the governance of a community pool, suggesting it should be governed by the people involved in the project. They also acknowledged the potential issues with governance in such a setup.
		- As for governance aspect, who decides what - the community decided by way of prediction market.
		- > When a betting market clearly estimates that a proposed policy would increase expected national welfare, that proposal becomes law.
	- ### Tribals" in Game-Like Setting Discussion
		- Thomas and Zaki discussed the concept of feeding and reproducing fictional "tribals" in a game-like setting. Zaki proposed that tribals don't necessarily need to be fed daily, but if players want to increase their tribals, they would need to invest "T." Thomas introduced the idea of a "triple daycare," where players could pay to have their tribals taken care of. They also discussed a popular project by Avogachi, which Thomas suggested could serve as a model for their own system. The possibility of introducing new, more elaborate "tribals" was also mentioned.
	- ### Project Budget and Upcoming Travel
		- Thomas and Zaki discussed a budget of 50K for a project, with Thomas planning to review design aspects and communicate further over telegram. They also touched on Zaki's upcoming travel plans, including a visit to New York and Austin, and potential events in Austin during the summer. A deadline for their project was mentioned, but no specific timeframe was provided by Zaki, who planned to discuss it with Bob.
