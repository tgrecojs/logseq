    		- RS Pack is widely used for backend APIs, and its integration with NX is moving towards mainstream adoption.
    		- Migrating from Webpack to RsPack can be challenging due to the limitations of alternatives like esbuild and Vite, which don't align well with specific project needs.
    	- [06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iVa3U0qZqM&t=366) ðŸš€ RsPack is a versatile build tool that excels in non-web projects and simplifies ESM and CommonJS support, despite ongoing challenges in the transition to ESM.
    		- After initial skepticism, the speaker found RsPack to be an impressive build tool that supports various features and was easy to set up.
    		- For web development, switch to RS Build for its simplicity and defaults, while RS Pack is better suited for non-web projects like VS Code extensions.
    		- RsPack supports both CommonJS and ESM builds natively, allowing users to choose without hassle, which is beneficial for projects still using CommonJS.
    		- The transition to ESM in build tools is improving but still presents challenges, particularly with dependency management and compatibility issues.
    	- [10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iVa3U0qZqM&t=602) ðŸ”§ Upgrading Node packages often causes version conflicts, while modern tools improve ESM and CJS support, but challenges persist, highlighting the need for compatibility and the utility of RS build's plug-in system.
    		- Upgrading packages in backend Node APIs often leads to issues due to version conflicts, despite improvements in the process.
    		- Modern tools are driving improvements in Node's ESM and CJS support, but challenges remain, particularly with testing frameworks that struggle with ESM compatibility.
    		- The transition to ESM is beneficial but still incomplete, necessitating support for both ESM and CommonJS to ensure compatibility and smooth integration in various systems.
    		- RS build is a plug-in based tool that offers many features out of the box, making it easy to create additional plugins if needed.
