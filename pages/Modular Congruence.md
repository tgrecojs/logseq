- If two integers A a and and b end up at the same corner when the number is wrapped around a m dash gone, then we say a and B b are congruent modulo M.
- $$a \equiv b \pmod{m}$$
- ### Rules of $$a \equiv b \pmod{m}$$
	- `a` and `b` must leave the **Same remainder** when divided by `m`
		- **Example** -> $$10 \equiv 9 \: (\text{mod } m)$$
			- Approach 1:
				- 10 / 9 -> 1 mod 1
				- 100 / 9 -> 10 mod 1
			- Approach 2:
				- 100 - 10 = 90
				- 90 / 9 = 10
- ### Congruence class
	- For a given integer `a` and a modulus `m`, there are **infinitely many integers congruents to `a modulo m`**
	- **Standard Representitive**
		- Each congruence class modulo `m` will contain exactly one integer between 0 and `m - 1`.
		- This integer is known as the **standard representive** of the congruence class.
	- \begin{matrix}a\equiv b&\pmod{m}\\c\equiv d&\pmod{m},\end{matrix}
	- \begin{aligned}a+c&\equiv b+d&\pmod m\\a\times c&\equiv b\times d&\pmod m.\end{aligned}

- ## Arithmetic with Remainers
	- the remainder of a **sum** is equal to the remainder of the **sum** of the remainders and that
	- the remainder of a **product** is equal to the remainder of the **product** of the remainders.
