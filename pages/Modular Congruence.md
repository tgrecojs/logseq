- If two integers A a and and b end up at the same corner when the number is wrapped around a m dash gone, then we say a and B b are congruent modulo M.
- $$a \equiv b \pmod{m}$$
- ### Rules of $$a \equiv b \pmod{m}$$
	- `a` and `b` must leave the **Same remainder** when divided by `m`
		- Example - $$10 \equiv 9 \: (\text{}mod m)$$
