- The Endo Daemon provides users with a secure execution environment for creating Endo applications.
- `@endo/daemon`'s `main` module
	- **hands out to each module just enough authority to do the job needed by that particular module.**
- [[How Emily Tamed the Caml]]
	- Research paper by Mark Miller and Mark Steigler focused around "Emily", an OCaml subset that made the language comply with POLA best practices.
	- *Emily is a subset of OCaml that uses a design rule verifier to enforce object-capability principles. It demonstrates how memory-safe languages can be transformed into breach-resistant object-capability systems with little loss of either expressivity or performance.*
	- [[Application-Level Confinement is Insufficient]]
	- Takes an approach that is very similar to the one taken by Endo.
		- Jessie.js disallows the use of `Array.prototype.push.
		- In Emily, "hidden-but-present memory-violating functions (such as `Array.unsafe_set`) are disallowed"
	- "Providing the reference to an object must grant the permission to use the object."
		- It is not enough to just provide an application with a reference to `fs.readFile`. **In order to use `fs.readFile`, the application must hold the powers necessary to work with `fs`.**
