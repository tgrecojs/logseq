- Bayes believed that d mathematics influence our decion making.
- They didn't have the computers of the data we have today!
### Bayesian
- a formal way to update the level of confidence in a belief.
- For bayesians, this rule is the be-all and end-all for achieving optimal outcomes.A systematic way of reasoning about something over time.
### Conditional Probability
- $$P\left(H\left|e\right.\right)=\frac{P\left(H\left|e\right|\right)P\left(H\right)}{P\left(e\right)}$$

  output:: P\left(H\left|e\right|\right)=\frac{P\left(e\left|H\right.\right)P\left(H\right)}{P\left(e\right)}
-
- H
	- Anything we can believe in thre world
- e
	- something that influences our degree of believe in `H`.
- How do we update the probability of `H` given that we observe `e`.
- Posterier Probability
## Evaluating
	- ### `P(H)`
		- Prior probability.
	- ### `P(e|H)`
	- Known as the likelihood.
	- Observing the influence, not the outcome.
		- The 2024 Super Bowl will be postponed due to weather.
			- There will be bad weather leading up and throughout the game.
	- `P(e)`
		- Probability of the evidence.
			- How frequently is the weather so bad that the Super Bowl can not be played?
