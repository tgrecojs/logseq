- can you help me work through a scenario. i would like to create a derivative product representing a 2x long position. we will call these "LNL" tokens - "Lounge 'n' Leverage".  The name is subject to change, however it is a great description of the service LnL token holders receive.
- ## How they work
- LnL tokens are powered by CDP stablecoin protocol, Inter (or Inter Protocol). Inter's mechanism for minting $IST is very similiar to Maker DAO's process for minting $DAI.  Both protocols form the basis for speculating on assets using leverage as users can exchange their newly minted stable-coins can be used to purchase more collateral.

- ## Overview of Inter Protocol
	- A user opens a **vault** by depositing a payment from one of the accepted collateral types
	- Inter allows users to create  "vaults" using one of the protocol's accepted collateral types.
	  it mints the stablecoin $IST.
	-
- A "vault" is made on inter-protocol.
  logseq.order-list-type:: number
- $1M in $ATOM is deposited.
  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- "vault" now has ability to mint upto $50000 $IST.
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
- ### Minting LnL Tokens
  * I'd like to mint 1000 LnL tokens with each token representing the underlying collateral and debt.
