## Preface
	- We are in a time
	- ### More than just a game (My Opionon) Decentralized systems
		-
		- The financial industry
		-
- We're building systems that have
- derivative product representing a 2x long position. we will call these "LNL" tokens - "Lounge 'n' Leverage".
-
- The name is subject to change, however it is a great description of the service LnL token holders receive.
-
	- Please be aware that I use the terms
		- "coins" means "cryptocurrency"
- ## How they work
	- A position, or *vault*, is created, open.
		- Once a vault is created, the holder of the object can mint $IST.

			- Each $IST for additional collateral minted $IST

			- LNL tokens
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- LNL tokens are derived from
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- shared “vault”     CDP stablecoin protocol, Inter (or Inter Protocol). Stable-coins play a critical role in blockchain-based economies. They form the basis for marketplaces to emerge medium-of-exchange.

			- It is unrealistic to envision the future of blockchain technology being one in which users pay for goods or services with a volatile assets, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum. It is extremely hard to accurately dictate prices that are denominated using volatile assets. For example, imagine if we were forced to choose between paying for our groceries using either Gold or Silver. The grocery store would have to constantly monitor each asset, and adjust their prices accordingly. Meanwhile, buyers would no longer have peace-of-mind that comes from the relative stability of currencies like US Dollar ($USD) and the Euro ($EUR).
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
- This need for stable medium-of-exchange translates into the blockchain ecosystem. Thus far, there have been two dominant systems of minting stable-coins that have emerged.
	- Fiat-backed stablecoins
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- The coins have a reserve of fiat currency that exists off-chain (i.e. in a bank account). For example, $USDC is a fiat-backed stablecoin. When $USDC is minted, then this reserve must grow, and when $USDC is "burned", the reserve will shrink.
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- In simple terms - Let's take a scenario in which circle has minted 1 million $USDC. For this to occur, then $1M must be placed into the reserve so that each coin is accounted for. Otherwise, it is not truly fiat-backed.

	- assets have proven to be strong    cryptocurrencies such as $IST, $DAI, and $USDC have    Inter's mechanism for minting $IST is very similar to Maker DAO's process for minting $DAI. Maker allows users to open “vaults” by depositing Ethereum. The user can choose to mint $IST, a cryptocurrency pegged at $1.

	- can take their newly minted $IST
	- This process is described below:
	-
-
- DAI and $IST
- Both protocols form the basis for speculating on assets using leverage as users can exchange their newly minted stable-coins can be used to purchase more collateral.
-
-
- ## Overview of Inter Protocol
	- A user opens a **vault** by depositing a payment from one of the accepted collateral types
	- Inter allows users to create  "vaults" using one of the protocol's accepted collateral types.
	  it mints the stablecoin $IST.

- Here is more information on the markets supported by Inter Protocol:
	- $ATOM
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Current Price $10.
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Maximum Loan-to-Value - 55%
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Liqudation Threshold - 60%

- A "vault" is made opened inter-protocol. The owner of the vault uses $1M work of $ATOM.
  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- "vault" now has ability to mint upto $50000 $IST.

- ### Minting LnL Tokens
  * I'd like to mint 1000 LnL tokens with each token representing the underlying collateral and debt.
