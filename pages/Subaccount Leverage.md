- can you help me work through a scenario. i would like to create a derivative product representing a 2x long position. we will call these "LNL" tokens - "Lounge 'n' Leverage".  The name is subject to change, however it is a great description of the service LnL token holders receive.
- ## How they work
- LnL tokens are powered by CDP stablecoin protocol, Inter (or Inter Protocol). These protocols form the basis for speculating on assets using leverage as they give user's the ability to mint stable-coins against collateral, which can then be used to purchase additional
- Inter's mechanism for minting $IST is very similiar to Maker DAO's process for minting $DAI.
-
- A user opens a **vault** by depositing a payment from one of the accepted collateral types
- Inter allows users to create  "vaults" using one of the protocol's accepted collateral types.
  it mints the stablecoin $IST. 
  
  stablecoin protocol
  
  The system works as follows:
- A "vault" is made on inter-protocol.
  logseq.order-list-type:: number
- $1M in $ATOM is deposited.
  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- "vault" now has ability to mint upto $50000 $IST.
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
- ### Minting LnL Tokens
  * I'd like to mint 1000 LnL tokens with each token representing the underlying collateral and debt.
