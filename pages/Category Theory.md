- Category theory is a branch of [abstract algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_algebra) that studies the properties of mathematical structures and their relationships through the use of **categories**.
- A category consist of:
	- Objects:
		- In the context of programming, objects take the form of sets of types (Numbers, Booleans, Objects)
	- Arrows (Morphisms)
		- Arrows are how we express relationships between categories.
