## Overview
	- A Margin Requirement is the percentage of marginable securities that an investor must pay for with his/her own cash.
	- It can be further broken down into:
		- **Initial Margin Requirement**
		- **Maintenance Margin Requirement**.
	- > According to Regulation T of the Federal Reserve Board, the Initial Margin requirement for stocks is 50%, and the Maintenance Margin Requirement is 25%, while higher requirements for both might apply for certain securities.
	- ### Initial Margin Requirement
		- The percentage of equity required when an investor opens a position.
		- ### Example - Alice and ABC Stock
		- ABC stock has an initial margin requirement of 50%. Alice wishes to get $10k exposure to ABC stock, which has an initial margin requirement of 50%.
		- Alice needs to provide at least $5k of her own cash to access a position equal to $10k exposure. This $10k is referred to as her **buying power**.
