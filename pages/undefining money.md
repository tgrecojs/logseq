- Okay, I’m getting excited again by this whole “uninventing money”/“post-money” idea that Chris Goes, Ethan Buchmann, and Andrew Miller have been on about for years.
- (WARNING: long rambling thread ahead with no “TLDR” summary.)
- ⤵️
- It’s heady stuff and I’ve struggled to understand it, so I’m going to post my simplified and possibly mistaken version here as a way to learn from others:
- ⤵️
- First thing that surprised/confused me: credit networks are in some sense more important than cash! (But in another sense cash is more important — see below.)
- By “credit networks”, they mean that Alice owes Bob $100, Bob owes Charlie $25, and Charlie owes Alice $50.
- ⤵️
- The above-mentioned thinkers argue that in some ways, this network of people (and orgs—companies, governments, DAOs, whatever) owing each other is bigger and more important than the set of “who owns how many dollars right now”.
- ⤵️
- There are multiple ways to think about “bigger and more important”. One aspect (that I attribute to Andrew Miller in my memories) is that credit networks are used by friends, family, fellow church-members, etc. They are part of the *local* social fabric. That’s important.
- ⤵️
- (Ethan Buchmann also keeps referring to “local currencies”/“LETS”, which I always thought were some kind of communism-flavored scam because they are often branded as “democratic” and “against capitalism”, but this makes me appreciate the theory behind them more.)
- ⤵️
- But another simple, objective way to evaluate credit networks vs cash is to ask “How much total value is in that system?”. I don’t have hard numbers but I have the vague idea that it is at least 10x or 100x as much in credit networks as in hard assets.
- ⤵️
- So the basic idea of “how could we build something new that improves the world” is, make a system where Alice, Bob, and Charlie can at least partially settle *without having to acquire and use cash*.
- ⤵️
- That is, if Alice-$100➡️Bob-$25➡️Charlie-$50➡️Alice, one way they could settle is Alice acquires $100, sends it to Bob, Bob sends $25 of it to Charlie, and Charlie acquires an additional $25 and sends $50 to Alice. Now the debts are cleared out and Bob has more cash.

- But that process is super inefficient! It can be expensive/difficult/time-consuming for Alice and Charlie to acquire that cash, and it doesn’t benefit anyone (other than by allowing Bob, who is $75 richer, to trade with people outside that network).

- The next thing that was surprising was that there is a “hierarchy of money”. I learned this from this article that Ethan Buchmann linked to: [https://sites.bu.edu/perry/files/2019/01/Lec-02-The-Natural-Hierarchy-of-Money.pdf…](https://sites.bu.edu/perry/files/2019/01/Lec-02-The-Natural-Hierarchy-of-Money.pdf)

- Here’s my simple-minded understanding of this concept of The Hierarchy of Money:
- If Alice, Bob, and Charlie have that credit cycle, they can settle it by acquiring PayPal dollars and PayPaling each other.
- ⤵️
- But if PayPal, Bank of America, and WellsFargo owe each other, they can’t settle with PayPal-dollars, they have to use U.S. Treasuries or something like that.
- ⤵️
- And if the U.S. Treasury Department, the People’s Bank of China, and the Bank of France owe each other, they can’t settle with U.S. Treasuries, they have to use boats full of gold bars or something.
- ⤵️
- What is this “settling” action that we’re talking about? I think it is basically just “making the payment irreversible”. Plus that the resulting asset isn’t vulnerable to one party diluting (inflating) it.
- (Plus one more requirement… see the end of this thread…)
- ⤵️
- A friend recently asked for advice. He sold something on Facebook marketplace, and he had gotten paid in PayPal dollars, but he wasn’t sure it was safe to send the goods yet. My advice: withdraw it from PayPal to your bank account, then you can send the goods.
- ⤵️
- In other words, he needs to *convert* his money from one form (PayPal-dollars, where it is in some sense just a debt to him from PayPal), into another form to make his ownership irrevocable (by PayPal).
- ⤵️
- There is a hierarchy of money, and what seems like hard money to the users at one layer is actually credit among the players at the next layer down.
- ⤵️
- Part of what excites me about “uninventing money”/“post-money” is these big ideas, but part is just how simple and actionable it is to enable Alice, Bob, and Charlie to settle at least part of their debt quickly and cheaply, without having to acquire cash to do so.
- ⤵️
- If Alice $100![➡️](https://abs-0.twimg.com/emoji/v2/svg/27a1.svg)Bob $25![➡️](https://abs-0.twimg.com/emoji/v2/svg/27a1.svg)Charlie $50![➡️](https://abs-0.twimg.com/emoji/v2/svg/27a1.svg)Alice, the system could just say “Ok everyone, now Alice $75![➡️](https://abs-0.twimg.com/emoji/v2/svg/27a1.svg)Bob $0![➡️](https://abs-0.twimg.com/emoji/v2/svg/27a1.svg)Charlie $25![➡️](https://abs-0.twimg.com/emoji/v2/svg/27a1.svg)Alice.”.

- I’m excited to see how this simple concept works in practice. I *guess* the same system can also help people *lend* money to each other, but I haven’t thought that part through yet.
- ⤵️
- Apparently [@circles](https://twitter.com/Circles) (with Ethan Buchmann and Andrew Miller) is all about this, and I would imagine that [@anoma](https://twitter.com/anoma)’s “intents” (with Chris Goes) relate. Looking forward to seeing these deployed to real users. Let’s go!
- ⤵️
- And how I see Zcash fitting into all this? It’s hardest of hard money! It is harder than U.S. Treasuries or gold because its supply is known and is capped at 21 million ZEC, and it is harder than Bitcoin because of that third requirement that I alluded to above: fungibility.
