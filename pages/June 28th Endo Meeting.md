- Extending Ocapn to have a binary string data type.
- ## Endow
- I pulled down the recent updates to daemon.
- Introduced the following issue:
	- running `import-bundle` would throw an error `RemoteTypeError(error:captp:Endo#20001)#6: namespace.endow is not a function`
	- I simply renamed the export to use `endow`
- ### Outbox and Powers
	- An outbox is an object that you grant to another power.
