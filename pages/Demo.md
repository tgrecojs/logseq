## Notes
	- Alice starts out with no inventory
	- Persists through restarts
	- Messages are persisted yet because it hasn't been implemented yet.
	- ### Design is largely based on Spritely
		- How does alice know that 1kce game is an app
		- Using the endo cli we can inspect in the UI or in the CLI.
		- The internal type for the game (or any web app) is "web bundle".
	- ### Unsafe
		- Unsafe objects doesn't necessarily mean that they are unsafe but rather that it's running off of the filesystem and using pure node.js to do so.
	- ### Profiles
		- Syntehsizing the profile
		- The spritely demo shows that what we've been calling hosts and guests are kinds of profiles.
			- They have their own petnames,
			- inbox for receiving messages, etc.

	- ### Installing the App
