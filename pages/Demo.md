## Notes
	- Alice starts out with no inventory
	- Persists through restarts
	- Messages are persisted yet because it hasn't been implemented yet.
	- ### Design is largely based on Spritely
		- How does alice know that 1kce game is an app
		- Using the endo cli we can inspect in the UI or in the CLI.
		- The internal type for the game (or any web app) is "web bundle".
	- ### Unsafe
		- Unsafe objects doesn't necessarily mean that they are unsafe but rather that it's running off of the filesystem and using pure node.js to do so.
	- ### Profiles
		- Syntehsizing the profile
		- The spritely demo shows that what we've been calling hosts and guests are kinds of profiles.
			- They have their own petnames,
			- inbox for receiving messages, etc.
		- Send a card from the deck
		-
		-
	- ### How guests and workers relate
		- a worker is a process
		- a guest is an inbox (a profile)
		- Everytime you create a caplet it spawns a new worker
		- problematic - want to make them more orthogonal?
	- `Endo make -w <> -p guestname -b bundlename`
		- a capbility given the powers of that guest in the named worker.
		- if you omit the worker it spawns it
		- if you omit -p it gives you least Authority
		- if you omit -b it creates a bundle for you.
	- ### Wanted
		- A trace aggregator
		- workers can expose Exposing a CapTP endpoint for flushing their internal buffers for errors.
		- Errors can be collected and ascribed to petname workers for the purpose of following traces.
			- Hey this happened in worker x because of something that happened in worker Y.
	- Chat list
		- Filters the messages
		- The treble of the powers, the bundle,
		- Reasonable to send the bundle along with the powers.
		- Sending the app implies that you're sending your own powers with it.
		- Wants
			- Implicit profiles for receiving caplets.
			- an undeniable metaobject that exists within your inbox.
				- What are the properties of the formula behind this thing i've been sent without directly putting them inside your inventory.
			- If you're the host (ower of an app) you should be able to revoke it.

	- ### Installing the App
		- Installing the Application
		- Alice adopts the game
		- Transferring objects
	- ### Profiles

- ## December 13th Notes
	- ## E and Far as globals
		- Markm - thinking on
	- ### Reason Not To
		- Global scope for caplets.
	- ### E
		- is API sugar or interacting with handle promises
		- eventual-send syntax is based off of the eventual send syntax.
	- ### Whenables
		- Psuedo-promises
		- Not itself be a thennable, but it is something that E would treat as promise-like and E.when would treat as promise-like.
	- Start with a default caplet
	- Any motivation for leaving them out?
		- Performance
		- Eventual-Send 2x instantiating time.
		- bundles create their own copies of everything.
			- problem to be solved on its own
