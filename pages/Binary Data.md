- Computers have electronic wires and circuits
	- A wire with electricity flowing through it can either be:
		- On or Off
		- True of False
		- 1 or 0
- Bits allow us to represent lots of data.
- ### Binary vs Decimal
	- Number system mulitplies by 2 each time
	- Goes from left to right
		- 1001
			- 1s
			- 2s
			- 4s
			- 8s
			- 16s
			- 32s
			- 64
			- 128
			- 256
			-
		- (1 * 8) + (0 * 4) + (0 * 2) + (1 * 1) = 9
		- 1001 = 9
	- **With 8 wires, you can represent numbers 0-255**
		- `[11010111]`
