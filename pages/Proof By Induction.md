- How JavaScript's Prototype chain works:
	- When a new object is created, it has the hidden field `__proto__`.
		- `__proto__`
			- points to the object that an object *inherits from*
- **Proof by Induction**
	- Proof by induction is a mathematical technique used to prove that a statement is true for all natural numbers.
	- The proof involves two steps:
		- a base case, which shows that the statement is true for the smallest possible value of the natural number
		- an inductive step, which shows that if the statement is true for a particular natural number, then it must also be true for the next natural number.
	- By combining these two steps, we can conclude that the statement is true for all natural numbers.
