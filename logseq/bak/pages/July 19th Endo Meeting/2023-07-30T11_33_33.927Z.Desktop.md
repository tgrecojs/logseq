	- hope you're doing well!
	- just wanted to give you a quick update as it's been a bit since we spoke. I think i may have mentioned this prior but my team is building a lending platform atop agoric's blockchain and that has occupied a lot of my time as of lately. it's been a grind but a fruitful one at least! I've been getting quite cozy working with the @endo/exo package but outside of exo, Far and bundle-source, there isn't significant overlap between building on agoric, and all of the packages endo has to offer.
	- key kris - I've begun addressing your comments on the pet daemon docs. i'm finding that they're really useful tips for how I should be phrasing things so thanks again for that feedback.i will have an update there for you by the end of this week, likely tomorrow. I'll shoot you a message at that time just so you're aware. I'm going to have added in some more commands as the cli has seen the addition of quite a few more since I initially started out.
