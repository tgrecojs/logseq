# Deployinh Smart Contracts

- # Deploy Script Support 
    - To install code on chain or in the a3p-integration environment, you'll have to generate a proposal, and write a script to build the core proposal. The proposals have limited access to bootstrap powers, described by their manifests. There are collections of proposals in .../vats/src/proposals, smart-wallet/src/proposals, orchestration/src/proposals, pegasus/src/proposals. The overall format is a proposalBuilder script (There are several in .../builders/scripts/vats/) which has a default export that passes resources to the proposal. The resources include bundled source code and string-value parameters. The ProposalBuilder specifies (as an import string) the proposal it uses, identifies the "manifest", (which associates permissions to access powers in the bootstrap space with functions to be called), and builds bundles of source code needed by the proposal. `.../builders/scripts/vats/upgradeVaults.js` is a canonical example. It says the proposal to run is '@agoric/inter-protocol/src/proposals/upgrade-vaults.js', lists the manifest there as `'getManifestForUpgradeVaults'`, and directs the creation of a bundle from '@agoric/inter-protocol/src/vaultFactory/vaultFactory.js', which will be made available to the proposal as `vaultsRef` in options. `upgrade-vaults.js` defines `getManifestForUpgradeVaults()`, which returns a `manifest` that says `upgradeVaults()` should be executed, and specifies what powers it should have access to. 
  - ### Proposal 
      - The proposal is called with `(powers, options)` available. The manifest detailing the powers that will be used is usually in the same file, and conventionally provided by a function named `getManifestForFoo`. The manifest needs to have a unique name, since it will be referenced by name from the script. The usual format is 

       - 
       ```js 

        export const foo = async ({ consume: {}, brands: {} }, options) => {
          const { fooRef } = options; // do the things using powers and options
        };

        const fooName = "foo";
        export const getManifestForFoo = (powers, options) => ({
          manifest: {
            [fooName]: {
              consume: { power: "a" },
            },
          },
        });

        ``` 

        - `manifest` contains descriptions of powers to be provided to the proposals
 
  - ### proposalBuilder Script 
      - The script describes how to build the core proposal. For `agoric-3-proposals` and uploading to the chain, the script must be named in the `CoreProposalSteps` section in [`upgrade.go`](../../golang/cosmos/app/upgrade.go), and its `defaultProposalBuilder` will be invoked directly. Script files should export `defaultProposalBuilder` and a `default` function that invokes `writeCoreProposal` one or more times to generate sets of files describing the proposal. 

        - 
        ```js 

          export const defaultProposalBuilder = ({ publishRef, install }) => {
            return harden({
              sourceSpec: "@agoric/vats/src/proposals/foo.js",
              getManifestCall: [
                "getManifestForFoo",
                {
                  fooRef: publishRef(install("@agoric/...")),
                  ...otherParams,
                },
              ],
            });
          };


          export default async (homeP, endowments) => {   
            const { writeCoreProposal } = await makeHelpers(homeP, endowments);  
            await writeCoreProposal('proposalName', defaultProposalBuilder); 
            }; 

          ``` 
    - The first element of `getManifestCall` is interpreted as the name of a proposal. The second element of `getManifestCall` produces the `options` argument passed to the proposal. (`fooRef` in the example above). A common thing to want to pass in options is a reference to code to be installed on-chain. The `fooRef` example above shows how. `publishRef(install(<path>))` is built from sources in the sdk, and passed as a `bundleRef`, which contains a `bundleID` suitable for passing to Zoe (for contracts) or `vatAdminService` (for non-contract vat code).
