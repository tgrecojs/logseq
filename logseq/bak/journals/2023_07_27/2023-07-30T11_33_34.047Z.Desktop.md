- # Kademlia
	- A P2P storage and look-up system.
- ## System Description
	- Each node has a 160-bit node ID
		- chosen at random when joining the system.
	- Every message a node transmits includes its node ID
		- This allows receiver to record the sender's existence (if necessary)
	- ### XOR
		- given two identifiers, `x` and `y`, **the distance between them is computed as their bitwise exclusive (or XOR) interpreted as an integer.**
		- $$d\left(x,y\right)=x\oplus y$$
		- if `x=y`
			- $$ (x,x)=0,d(x,y)>0 $$
		- $$∀x, y : d(x, y) = d(y, x)$$
		- **Triangle Property**
			- The triangle property follows from the fact that
				- $$d(x, z) = d(x, y) ⊕ d(y, z) \\ and \\ ∀a ≥ 0, b ≥ 0 : a + b ≥ a ⊕ b.$$
			- $$d(x, y) + d(y, z) ≥ d(x, z).$$

	- ### Node State
		- Kademlia nodes store contact information about each other to route query messages.
