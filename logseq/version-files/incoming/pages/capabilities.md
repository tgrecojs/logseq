	- #### Object-Capability Model
		- a model of computation and security that aims to capture the semantics of many actual object-based programming languages and capability-based systems.
	- #### Object-Capability System
		- An instance of the model and comprises just a collection of objects, connected to each other by capabilities.
		- An object is a protected entity comprising code and mutable state that together deﬁne its behaviour.
		- An object’s state includes both data and the capabilities it possesses.
			- A capability c is an unforgeable object reference that allows its holder to send messages to the object it references by invoking c. In any object-capability system, capabilities and data are primitively distinct, meaning that each can always be distinguished from the other 6 .

			- > Autognosis means ‘self knowledge’. An autognostic object can only have detailed knowledge of itself. All other objects are abstract. The converse is quite useful: any programming model that allows inspection of the representation of more than one abstraction at a time is not object-oriented.
