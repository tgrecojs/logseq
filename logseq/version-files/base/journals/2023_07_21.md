- ### IPFS x UCAN x Endo
	-
	-
	- In order for applications to use IPFS they require using something like a gateway to ensures liveliness for a CID (or sets of CIDs) so that they're retrievable. I've been thinking about Endo and IPFS in the context of P2P communications between users of the platform i'm building atop agoric. These conversations are intended to be private and won't be stored on a blockchain. The a-ha moment was when i realized that this might not even require data to be hosted anywhere, and everything could be held locally on the participants' machines.
	- I haven't thought through this much but I'm imagining users could take some action signifying that they wish to be introduced to another user.
	- Once introduced, they would then be able to communicate back and forth, and at the end of the conversation, a hash of the latest conversation would be created, and stored on each persons machine. This hash could be the entire conversation, or just the latest one which could then be combined the hashes of prior chat logs... perhaps all that would be needed is a pointer to the previous conversation. Whatever the case, this content would be stored locally.
	- I haven't thought through this is in much detail, at all. But I wanted to ask you as I figured you would know where or not I'm on to something in the belief that IPFS gateways could be eliminated entirely in place of this locally focused system.

	- removing dependencies on the various aspects of their systems required to operatg

	- This would make

	- zipfile could be created then encrypts the contents of their chat and stores.

	- interface with one another
	- But what if everything was local. The time i've spent working with the Endo Daemon has given me perspective on how to provide users with
	- made me think that aforementioned gateways, and even IPFS as a whole, could be eliminated from this process
	-
	-
	- What if you could create a Merkle DAG that stored user's conversations locally on their machine (could be given access to a "save" button that downloads this).
	- Every time you interact in a chat, a new node is created.

	- ### Kris' legendary hat
		- **NOT the sorting hat**
		- Comfortability - Imposter syndrome makes you (incorrectly) perceive that you don't belong... that you're out of place. The hat acts a guarantor for being out of place :).
		- If he takes it off he is invisible though because *we all look alike*.

	- ### Issues with how we hire.
		- We might find ourselves in a scenario where we end up hiring a broom ðŸ§¹.
		- We might find a way to effectively hire more broom! And then end up with a team..!...... th-..that's .... made up of brooms ðŸ§¹
	- ### The secret sauce
		- > **Hire not for culture fit, but for culture add!**
	- ## Design Patterns that should not be named
		- What they have in common - **they nest**
			- Promises
			- Parsers
			- State machines
		- ## LOL

		- Functions that return things. Functions that return callbacks also return things!
