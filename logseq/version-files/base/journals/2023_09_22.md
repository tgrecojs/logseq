### Sufyaan Meeting #[[agoric sdk]]
	- #### Background
		- Worked in TradFi prior to transitioning into blockchain space full-time.
		- Took time to assess the ecosystem and get a lay of the land before making a absolute movement into the sector. Saw the issues with smart contracts.
			- Sentiment I still believe today - smart contract security needs a major shift in order for blockchain to reach its true potential and ultimately gain mainstream adoption.
			- Agoric is providing a pathway to accomplishing this with object capabilities.
	- #### My Experience with Agoric
		- Tremendously difficult. I'm constantly engaging in new processes and my peers are some of the best computer scientists to have ever walked the earth.
		- Tremendously rewarding.
