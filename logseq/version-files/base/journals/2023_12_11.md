- the Contact verifies proofs against the root.
- the client side provides the proof
- ### 3 roles
	- 1. Contract deployer who generates the merkle tree of chain
	- contract that verifies merkle proofs against the root
	- client which generates a proof from the adderss
- A merkle tree is constructed
  logseq.order-list-type:: number
