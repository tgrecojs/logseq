- Tree Construction Process
  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- Airdrop Owner (person creating the campaign) provides a list of wallet addresses.
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- addresses are passed into a function, `constructMerkleTree`, which sits between the client-side and the contract code. 
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- Following `constructMerkleTree` execution, an instance of an "AirdropCampaign" smart contract in instantiated on agoric's blockchain. During the `startInstance` phase, the root of the tree is passed into the contracts `terms` argument
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
- Address Verification Process
  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- The `AirdropCampaign` contract exposes a method, `checkWalletAddress`, which is fixed to the tree root (obtained via `zcf.getTerms()`).
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- users check if their eligible by passing in their wallet address as input to `checkWalletAddress`. This can return a boolean value that is used to display whether or not they are eligible on the UI. If applicable, this can even return an NFT to those who are eligible in addition to confirming their eligibility, while those who are ineligible are informed of their ineligibility and receive nothing.
