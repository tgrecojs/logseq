		- About the different types of streams (`WritableStream`,`ReadableStreams`, `TransformStreams`)
		- streams are read in **chunks**.

		- A `ReadableStream` is said to be **locked** to the consumer that is reading its data.
		- Last one ➡️
			- Streams can not be locked to more than one writer or reader at a time. *Enter... Teeing Strategies*
			- Teeing is the term for splitting a stream into two identical copies **which can then be read by two separate readers**.
