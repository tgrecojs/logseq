- ## Great Day!
- ### Achieved:
- Smart Contract Dev
	- Powered through the implementation of the `loanExo` object.
	- `loanExo`
		- State
			- `debtKey`
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- `debtBrand`
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- `loanNode` - ChainStorageNode that is a descendant of the `rootNode`. Each `loanNode` is created using its `id` as its unique identifier.
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- `contractSeat`
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
				- holds the allocation.
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
				- when `initState` is called, the `contractSeat` is in holding the allocations (supplied via the lender.)
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- `debtSeat`
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
				- lender seat
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number

- ### Got a formal introduction in using #Streams
	- I learned....
		- About the different types of streams (`WritableStream`,`ReadableStreams`, `TransformStreams`)
		- streams are read in **chunks**.
		- Streams process chunks via a queing strategy. Specificially, they push chunks onto a queue where they stay until they are read.
		- A `ReadableStream` is said to be **locked** to the consumer that is reading its data.
		- Last one ➡️
			- Streams can not be locked to more than one writer or reader at a time. *Enter... Teeing Strategies*
			- Teeing is the term for splitting a stream into two identical copies **which can then be read by two separate readers**.
