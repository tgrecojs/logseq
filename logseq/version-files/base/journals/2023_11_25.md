## `+=` vs `++` #[[TIL Series]]
	- Today I took a look into the JavaScript specification to get a better understanding regarding how to increment numbers. Now I had previous experience doing this. But it's nearly impossible to have memorized all of the ins and outs of the JavaScript specification. So I decided to refresh my understanding of these concepts.
	- ### Compound Assignment vs. Increment & Decrement Operators
		- It may not be the most groundbreaking finding, however I was a bit surprised to learn that `+=`  or  `-=` were specific types of operators. They are **compound assignment** operators.
		- It has no impact on the behavior of a program but nonetheless, I thought it pretty amazing that I had gone my entire career and never learned this.
	- ### New Findings in prefix operators
		- Let's have a quick refresher on the *prefix* and *postfix* operators.
	- ```js
	  let a = 0;
	  let b = a++; // 
	  
	  let c = 0;
	  let d = ++c; // d is 6 and c becomes 6 as well
	  ```
