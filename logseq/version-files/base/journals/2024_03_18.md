- ## On base64 encoding #[[TIL Series]]
	- What is the benefit of Base64 encoding? How does Base64 provide advantages over traditional text encoding? If the base encoding of a string has more characters than the actual textual representation of that string, how can it be more memory efficient?
	- Base64 encoding is a binary-to-text encoding scheme that converts binary data into a string of ASCII characters. The primary benefits of Base64 encoding are:
	- 1. **Text Representation of Binary Data:** Base64 allows binary data, which might not be safely convertible to or from certain text encodings and could be corrupted by text processing systems, to be represented in a way that is safe for systems that only reliably handle text. This is needed for binary data in contexts that handle text, like sending images in an XML or JSON payload, embedding binary data in HTML, or sending email via SMTP that originally handled text-only content.
	- 2. **Transport Layer Compatibility:** Base64 is used to encode binary files for transport in systems where binary data could be modified or misinterpreted by the transport layer, such as via email or in URLs where only a limited set of characters is safely handled.
	- 3. **Data Integrity:** Since it uses a limited, known set of characters, Base64-encoded data is less likely to be misinterpreted or modified by intermediate systems like text editors, email clients, or any other software that processes text.
	- Base64 is not about memory efficiency compared to the original binary data. In fact, Base64-encoded data is approximately 33% larger than the original binary data. This is due to the encoding technique which represents each set of three bytes of the binary data as four characters from a limited subset of 64 characters (the 26 upper and lower-case letters of the Latin alphabet, digits 0 through 9, '+', '/', and sometimes '=').
	- The main advantage of Base64 isn't efficient storage but safe transport. If your goal is to minimize the size of the transmitted data, Base64 encoding is not the right tool. Compressing the binary data using a compression algorithm like ZIP or gzip before transmission (and then Base64 encoding if necessary for a text-only medium) may be more effective for that purpose.
	- In specific contexts where data needs to be stored in a text format but originated as binary, Base64 is not necessarily the most space-efficient but it is a well-understood, widely supported compromise to achieve reliable transport and storage in legacy systems designed primarily for text. For modern systems that can natively handle binary data, it's often better to skip Base64 encoding if the transport medium allows for it.
