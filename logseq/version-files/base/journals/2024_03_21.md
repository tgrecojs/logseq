		- ### Website-revamp bounty work
			- Questions surrounding work on the website-revamp repo.
				- While Tyler was on vacation, I talked to Scott Hewitt about getting compensated for the work I had been doing within the docs.
					- TODO **GET MESSAGE FROM HEWI MENTIONING PAID WORK ON DOCS**
				- We didn't get a chance to discuss this yet Ty.
				- Seeing as this meeting that very much has an open-door policy, I feel its a good venue to revisit this and get feedback.
					- ### Why it is needed?
						- There is a pretty significant need for assistance within the docs site.
						- Grammatical errors have stacked up throughout the years that the docs has been in existence and these need fixing.
						- There is a slew of content that is outdated and this needs fixing.
		- ## `akash-tools` work
			- Opened up a PR within the [akash-tools](https://github.com/arno01/akash-tools/issues/3) repo as well as an issue.
				- [#3](https://github.com/arno01/akash-tools/issues/3)
			- Created a gist that automates the set up for the video that walks through the configuratin.
				- Can i add this to the website? Is there any reason akash-tools isn't under the akash-network umbrella?
