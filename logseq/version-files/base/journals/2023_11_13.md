## Unforgeable Distributed Capabilities
- A capabilitiy is a transferrable unforgeable permission to use the thing it
-
- ## Permission vs Authority
	- #### May vs. Can
		- Authority and permission are two distinctly different concepts. (They seem to be used interchangeable. I admit that I am more than likely guilty of this and now that I'm informed I have no excuse.
		- Authority is *may* - The rules as *written* down.
		- What can be caused to happen.
	- ### In Memory Safe
		- ```
		  A, B, C
		  
		  A -> C
		  
		  ```
		  A invokes C, the runtime picks up the address of C and does whatever is necessary to make the invocation happen behave as programmed.
	- If B gets the address of A and is somehow able to use it to obtain the bits of the capability it desires.
	- ### Attack Vectors
		- Infer from Public Records
			- Apply deductive reasoning
		-
	- Cahoots
		- Side channel Attack
			- A can be in cahoots with B
		- Knowledge
