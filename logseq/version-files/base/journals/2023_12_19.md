## DCF Meeting
	- ### Okay, so how would you say Lawyer Finance embodies decentralization?
		- Okay, so for one, I have full intention of having this being governed by a DAO. There was never even any question as to if this would be a decentralized project or not.
		- Most of the thinking as it regards to decentralization was rooted in how can we build a protocol in which decentralization isn't a growth inhibitor.
	- Elaborate on decentralization being a growth inhibitor.
		- It's not even necessarily the decentralization that's a growth inhibitor. It's more the single pool design. But in order for an asset to get listed on a lending protocol, it needs to go through the Dow governance process. Now, let's say Build, for example. If we wanted to get Build listed as a valid collateral asset on Aave, well, we essentially have no shot. Our best bet is to just fork Aave. And so, I think there's a few, okay.
