## DCF Meeting
	- ### Okay, so how would you say Lawyer Finance embodies decentralization?
		- Okay, so for one, I have full intention of having this being governed by a DAO. I think that, I mean, there was never, there was never even any question as to if this would be a decentralized project or not. Rather, excuse me, rather, the question was, the question, or rather, most of the thinking as it regards to decentralization was rooted in how can we build a protocol in which decentralization isn't a growth inhibitor.
