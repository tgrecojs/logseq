- ## Vim Basics
  From today's learning about Vim text editor:
  
  1. Vim is a terminal-based text editor
  2. Basic commands learned:
	- Starting Vim: Type `vim` in terminal
	- Entering command mode: Press Shift + colon (`:`)
	- Quitting Vim: Type `:q` in command mode
- ## Key Observations
  1. Vim operates in different modes
  2. Command mode is accessed through the shift + colon combination
  3. Commands can be written in full (like "quit") or abbreviated (like "q")
- ## Course Structure Overview
  The complete Vim course covers:
  
  1. Basic movement and navigation
  2. Different Vim modes
  3. File saving operations
  4. Built-in commands
  5. Command combinations
  6. Copy and paste functionality
  7. Configuration options
  8. Config file management
  9. Plugin system
- ## Follow-up Items
  1. Practice basic Vim commands
  2. Review movement commands in next lesson
  3. Explore different Vim modes
  4. Learn file saving operations
- ## Moving Around
	- # Today's Learning Notes: Vim Navigation
	- ## Basic Vim Movement Commands
	  
	  1. Core navigation keys (home row position):
		- h: Move left one character
		- j: Move down one line
		- k: Move up one line
		- l: Move right one character
		  
		  2. Word navigation:
		- w: Move forward one word
		- b: Move backward one word
	- ## Key Benefits
	  
	  1. Efficiency benefits:
		- Keeps hands on the home row
		- Eliminates need for mouse usage
		- Faster navigation through text
		  
		  2. Ergonomic advantages:
		- Reduces hand movement
		- Minimizes reaching for arrow keys
		- More natural finger positioning
		  
		  This basic movement system forms the foundation for efficient text editing in Vim, emphasizing keyboard-driven navigation over mouse-based interaction.
	- Based on the window content, I'll help document your learning about Vim's different modes from the egghead.io lesson:
	- # Vim Modes Learning Notes - January 7, 2025
	  
	  1. **Core Concept**
		- Vim is a modal editor
		- Each operation requires being in the correct mode
		- Mode status is shown in bottom left corner
		  
		  2. **Main Modes**

			- Default starting mode
			- Used for navigation
			- Used for text manipulation
			  
			  2. Command Mode
			- Accessed by pressing Shift + : (colon)
			- Shows prompt at bottom left
			- Used for entering editor commands
			  
			  3. Insert Mode
			- Accessed by pressing 'i'
			- Used for typing/inserting text
			- Exit by pressing Escape key
			  
			  4. Visual Mode
			- Accessed by pressing 'v'
			- Used for selecting text

- # VIM Command Learning Notes - January 7, 2025
- Based on the video content about combining VIM commands, here are the key learnings documented:
- ## Command Structure
  VIM commands typically follow a three-part structure:
  1. Action
  2. Location
  3. Context (second location)
- ## Command Reference Table
  
  | Command | Description | Example Use Case |
  |---------|-------------|-----------------|
  | `cit` | Change Inner Tag | Deletes content inside HTML tags and enters insert mode |
  | `ci{` | Change Inner Curly Braces | Deletes content inside curly braces and enters insert mode |
  | `ci"` | Change Inner Quotes | Deletes content inside quotation marks and enters insert mode |
  | `dw` | Delete Word | Deletes a word and stays in normal mode |
  | `cw` | Change Word | Deletes a word and enters insert mode |
- ## Key Concepts
  
  1. VIM treats text as objects that can be manipulated, not just as collections of letters
  2. Commands can be combined for more powerful editing capabilities
  3. VIM understands context-aware boundaries (tags, brackets, quotes)
  4. The system preserves important syntax elements (closing tags, quotes, braces) while manipulating inner content
- ## Common Patterns
  
  1. Using `c` (change) puts you into insert mode after deletion
  2. Using `d` (delete) keeps you in normal mode after deletion
  3. The `i` modifier typically refers to "inner" content
  4. Commands are composable and follow logical patterns
