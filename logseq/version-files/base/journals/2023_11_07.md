## Agoric Discussion
	- My familiarity with "Near" refs comes mainly from erights.org. I've linked to some articles below that helped me get an in-depth grasp on different kinds of references. 
	  
	  I still struggle to come up with concrete examples for "far" and "near" refs in the context of Agoric smart contracting systems (and distributed JavaScript execution in general), so I'm opening this discussion in an effort to get some clarity around the topic.
	-
	- `Far` appears everywhere, but I rarely come across references to "Near" objects in the agoric-sdk. The motivation behind this discussion stems from the makeZoeForTest function shown below. This function appears only twice in the entire Agoric SDK.
	-
	- You can see that this function takes an object with an optional `useNearRemote` property. A search of the agoric-sdk shows only 2 instances in which this option is set to true. I'd love to get some more input on how this function is used, when to use it, etc.
	- I'm including the `makeLoopback` function because it seems relevant to these discussionss
