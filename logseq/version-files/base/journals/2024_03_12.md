- Also, for the meeting we had on Friday, I think there's two action items on our end Or maybe just one just figuring out the map And seeing if We can use like bites for the kids like a You went eight array, like if you do a en code On the address I honestly don't know enough there to comment in the channels that I'm sending you the voice note But like a chat, GPT from Friday said that yes you can have keys in a map P You want a raise or like bites but you come into your face an issue when you do like that because The bites are in array So there's no equality like is basically like if you use an object as you make a new object and try to look it up, they could be equal but they're not gonna look up so you do need like a string or something to use the map So I don't think that approach would work and then I guess the second thing I did was it is a really poor test but I tried to estimate with chat GPT what a map with 100,000 addresses would look like And it was something like 10 MB So I would suggest maybe and I can help with this if I have more band with her I guess also owed floating the question to the team I don't know if I was supposed to come from Ivan but I'm kind of like afraid to talk about anything else this orchestra thing is going on But you could do like a test You load that up into that like you just run a local chain and there's some way to see how big the vet has gotten like like a very way you can just see how big the doctor image changes I think to see if my no way but That's one way you could test and I know like 10 MB is crazy in the Ethereum world but In programming in general, but if you're deleting it in the like after this thing is over, it's not a huge burden on the chain For my vantage point like yeah like size and stuff is not something you really think care about which script that much but I guess it's different in the context Yeah, I hope that helps her if it's not clear feel free to shoot me a text or we can do a quick call menu
