		- Installing the Akash CLI
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- execute proivder services and watch it fail
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- Install the CLI GitHub by downloading source from Github
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- Make sure binary location exists in users path
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- Confirm that `provider-services` is installed.
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- Show brew install process.
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
				- "see from the output it's been installed into a directory that exists within my path".
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
				- `brew uninstall` (or whatever command is used for)
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Set up your local environment
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- Among the goals of this lesson is to eliminate any notion of the `provider-services` CLI performing *magic* resulting in their ability to start interacting with the akash network from their machine. Instead, viewers will walk away from this lesson with a clear understanding of their local configuration  that provider-services is using when communicating with the Akash network, so that they can go on to manage these variables as necessary.
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- By the end of this lesson they will have used `provider-services` to successfully create a wallet before continuing on to integrate their newly created wallet with a browser-based wallet (keplr).

			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Deploying an application using `provider-servies`
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- By the end of this lesson the viewer will have walked through the steps of deploying an application on Akash starting at generating a certificate and ending with an active deployment. This lesson will be a bit more lengthy as it will cover the steps below.
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
				- generated a certificate using the `provider-services`.
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
				- create a deployment
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
				- view bids for a deployment.
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
				- accepted a bid and successfully entered into a lease with their chosen provider.
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
				- check the status of their deployment and confirmed that it is active.
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- *Each step will be accompanied by commentary as to what exactly the user is doing on each step of their journey to creating a deployment.*
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Closing an active lease using `provider-servies`
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- By the end of this lesson the viewer will have closed an active deployment and seen the effect this has had on their wallet balances, status of their deployment, etc.
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- First deployment on Cloudmos:
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- This lesson walks through the process of deplyoing an application on Akash using the Cloudmos UI.
			- By the end of this lesson the viewer will have walked through the steps of deploying an application on Akash starting at generating a certificate and ending with an active deployment. This lesson will be a bit more lengthy as it will cover the steps below.
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
				- generated a certificate directly in the Cloudmos UI
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
				- Created a deployment.yml file containing valid SDL syntax.
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
				- viewed and accepted bids from providers using the Cloudmos UI.
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
				- learned how to manage their deployment from the Cloudmos UI.
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number

		- Closing a deployment on the Cloudmos UI
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
