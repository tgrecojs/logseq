## Cloudflare Queues
	- A queue is a buffer or list that automatically scales as messages are written to it, and allows a consumer Worker to pull messages from that same queue.
	- Queues are designed to be reliable, and messages written to a queue should never be lost once the write succeeds. Similarly, messages are not deleted from a queue until the [consumer](https://developers.cloudflare.com/queues/reference/how-queues-works/#consumers) has successfully consumed the message.
	- Queues does not guarantee that messages will be delivered to a consumer in the same order in which they are published.
	- Developers can create multiple queues. Creating multiple queues can be useful to:
	- Separate different use-cases and processing requirements: for example, a logging queue vs. a password reset queue.
	- Horizontally scale your overall throughput (messages per second) by using multiple queues to scale out.
	- Configure different batching strategies for each consumer connected to a queue.
	  
	  For most applications, a single producer Worker per queue, with a single consumer Worker consuming messages from that queue allows you to logically separate the processing for each of your queues.
