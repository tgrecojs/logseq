		- Catamorphisms get data out of a dstructure in an elegant and cosnistent manner.
		- > catamorphism (from the the Greek: κατά "downwards" and μορφή "form, "shape")

			- "modular sum"
				- refers to the sum computation in modular arithmetic, also known as clock arithmetic.
		- **Modular arithmetic is a system of arithmetic for integers, where numbers "wrap around" when reaching a certain value—the modulus.**
			- The "modular sum" of two numbers ﻿a and ﻿b under a modulus ﻿m is ﻿(a + b) mod m. This means after adding ﻿a and ﻿b, we divide the result by ﻿m and then take the remainder. This could result in a number from ﻿0 to ﻿m-1.
			- For example, if ﻿a=7, ﻿b=6, and ﻿m=10, then the modular sum is ﻿(7 + 6) mod 10 = 3.
