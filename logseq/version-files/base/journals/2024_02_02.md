- ## Yaron - Risk DAO
	- Hope you've been well since we spoke. I wanted to circle back and see if you managed to dedicate any time educating yourself on ocaps, or more generally, the various problems plaguing current smart contracting systems developers  more about the Zoe framework agoric has built for developers  object capabilities.
	- Not sure if you got a chance to look through any of the ocaps materials.
	- When you get a chance to, then I'd love to have a follow up chat
