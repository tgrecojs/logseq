### **Project Overview: Tribble Coin**
- #### **Backstory: "Renegade Tribbles: A Fluffy Revolution"**
- In the neon haze of the 1970s, a band of renegade Tribbles, those famously adorable fluff balls from the starship corridors of pop culture fame, decided to buck the trend. Unlike their kin, who basked in the limelight of adoration from fans and thrived on the excitement of television screens, this particular group sought a different path. Dubbed the "Fluffernauts," these Tribbles, with their shimmering fur of rebellious hues, escaped into the obscure corners of the galaxy. Here, they embarked on a long sabbatical, eschewing fame for a quieter existence, where they could cultivate a deep philosophical ethos centered around intersubjectivity and mutual understanding. Their legend became but a whisper on the winds of space, known only to the most devout of cosmic wanderers.
- As centuries turned on backwater planets, the Fluffernauts evolved intellectually and spiritually. Their society was built on the foundational belief in collective existence, their thoughts as interwoven as their furs. Now, as the universe stands on the brink of a new blockchain-powered epoch, the time of the Fluffernauts has come. Spurred by cosmic currents and the alignment of digital stars, theyâ€™ve decided to re-enter the galactic stage. Launching their very own cryptocurrency, Tribbles and TribbleB, they aim to spread their ethos of intersubjectivity through the cosmos. Each token, a symbol of their collective philosophy, represents not just a piece of digital currency but a part of a larger, interconnected whole.
- #### **Token Mechanics and Distribution**
- Tribble (Primary Token)
	- **Fixed Supply**
		- Echoing the deflationary model of Bitcoin, Tribble will have a capped maximum supply.
	- Airdrop Mechanics:
		- **Cost**:  Each claim costs 1 IST.
		- **Tiered Retroactive Qualification**:
			- Eligibility and initial allocation amounts are determined by past interactions with related blockchain activities:
				- Top Tier: Users who have opened an Inter Protocol Vault, provisioned an Agoric Smart Contract, or staked BLD tokens.
				- Second Tier: Users who have interacted with ATOM token in the past four months.
		- **Claim Decay**:
			- The amount of Tribble claimable decreases by 50% per epoch, incentivizing swift action to maximize rewards.
		- **Dynamic Issuance Schema for Tribble (Base Supply: 10,000,000 Tokens)**
		- **Initial Base Supply**
			- Fixed Base: The project launches with an initial fixed base supply of 10,000,000 Tribbles available for claiming.
- #### **Dynamic Supply Expansion Conditions**
	- Expansion Trigger: The total supply is subject to increase if the number of claims within the first epoch (a predefined period, say 24 hours from launch) reaches certain thresholds.
	- Expansion Rate: For every 10,000 claims received within the first epoch, an additional 1% of the base supply (100,000 Tribbles) will be minted and added to the pool available for claims.
- #### **Claim Decay Mechanism**
	- Decay Rate: The amount of Tribble each user can claim decays by 50% each epoch. The initial epoch might allow a claim of, for instance, 100 Tribbles, which will reduce to 50 Tribbles if claimed in the second epoch, and so forth.
	- Decay Implementation: This decay applies from the moment the airdrop opens and affects the amount available per claim, encouraging early participation.
- #### **Supply Cap**
	- Absolute Cap: The total supply of Tribble will not exceed 150% of the base supply under any circumstances. This caps the total number of Tribbles at 15,000,000.
- #### Cap Implementation:
	- Once the total issuance reaches this cap, no further Tribbles will be minted regardless of claiming activity.
- ### **Example Scenario:**
	- Launch: The airdrop opens, and the community begins to claim Tribbles.
	- First 24 Hours: 100,000 claims are made. According to the expansion rate, this triggers an additional minting of 1,000,000 Tribbles (10 x 100,000), increasing the total supply to 11,000,000 Tribbles.
	- Post-First Epoch: Claims in subsequent epochs continue, but with each claim providing diminishing returns due to the decay mechanism.

- ### **TribbleB Minting Cost and Requirements**
- > To mint TribbleB, the process will involve both a cost component and a token burning mechanism:
	- TribbleB (Derived Token)
		- Creation: Can be minted by burning Tribbles.
		- Function: Supports a unique "Proof of Breed" governance model, where governance participation requires having bred at least one TribbleB, emphasizing active engagement in the ecosystem.
	- Burning Tribbles:
		- Amount: To mint one TribbleB, a user must burn 10 Tribbles. This process reduces the supply of Tribbles, potentially increasing the rarity and value of the remaining Tribbles.
	- Monetary Cost:
		- IST Requirement: In addition to burning Tribbles, minting one TribbleB requires the user to pay 1 IST per Tribble burnt.
- #### **Governance and Security**
- > Intersubjective Governance Model: Decisions are made collectively, emphasizing an ethos of shared understanding and equality:
	- Proof of Breed: Only participants who have actively engaged by breeding TribbleB can vote, ensuring that governance is influenced by those most invested in the ecosystem's health.
	- Equal Voting Rights: Each participant has one vote, regardless of the number of TribbleBs bred, maintaining fairness and preventing dominance by a few large holders.
