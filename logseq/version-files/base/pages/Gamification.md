- Agoric Airdrop Campaign Thoughts
	- An airdrop that acts as an invitation for a community of people in the Cosmos.
	- 0L network was in my mind at the time so i initially was thinking something similar to that but with the inclusion of an entry token.
	- Initial thoughts
		- There can be tiers or it can just be one flat fee to enter.
		- Pass is transferrable
			- Can lead to secondary market for buying and selling passes.
		- Initial ideas on possible features / perks
			- Connecting with others, Networking
			- Virtual arcade.
				- airdrop tokens are used as arcade tokens, or can be used to purchase game tokens.
				- free games with membership. user can pay for access to features (ex. eligible for high score list)
				- in the spirit of an arcade, games can pay out tickets which can be used to redeem prizes, one of which may be buying back tokens
			- Prediction markets surrounding development of tech in the ecosystem.
				- Ex. "What will be the outcome of proposal XYZ"
				- Tools for getting a temperature check on the community (proposals, project deadlines, etc.)
		- Community decides the way forward and can use the tokens to vote on the way forward.
		- Token distribution
			- can place a larger weight ecosystem commits, or any activities that we might want the target recipient to partake in.
			- Supply cap should be large enough to cultivate a solid group of people, but scare enough to make the tokens desirable.
			- If things do work out, and people want to join the community, then the community can vote on an airdrop for a new token redeemable for membership
				- Initial membership pass holds more weight (genesis members --> silver member --> bronze member)
		- Write up expressing mission, core values, etc. - lay a foundation for a framework for moving forward as a community.
