- Developers 
  looking to deploy new features on chain limit orders, and custom trading
   strategies can now build on top of the core libraries. Protocols become
   platforms, maker, synthetics, morpho, and others are building on this 
  trend heading into 2024. Other chains remain up for grabs. Trader Joe 
  dominates on Avalanche. Osmosis remains number one in the cosmos. Orca 
  sits atop Solana's exploding DeFi ecosystem, and PancakeSwap is still 
  basically the only game in town on B&B chain. I'd keep an eye on the
   projects below in 2024, if we see a combination of a regulator-led 
  asset d listings at major Western centralized exchanges, b. A melt-up in
   token prices following a Bitcoin ETF-driven rally, and c. The return of
   the hot ball of money trade for Solana cosmos and non-aetherium-based 
  DeFi. 8.2 trading aggregators and front-ends. The problem with the 
  decentralized in DeFi is that it has an undercurrent that suggests your 
  community would be okay limiting its potential take rate. What we've 
  seen repeatedly in DeFi this year has been quite the opposite. Following
   the announcement of Uniswap V4, Uniswap Labs announced a 0.15% fee on 
  transactions made on its Uniswap Labs-owned Web UI and Wallet. The 
  company is now making $1 million per month in front-end fees, as the new
   fee structure sits atop what the underlying protocol charges users on 
  behalf of its liquidity providers. This looks like a double dip, and I 
  hate the optics, as does Hasib. But I'll also defend it for a couple of 
  important reasons. 1. Regulatory realism. DeFi regulation in the US is 
  in a precarious spot, and there's a good chance Uniswap is dealing with a
   bevy of legal issues that force their hand. I don't think anyone is 
  happy with the idea of regulating front-end interfaces like brokers, but
   some investors are promoting this as the least bad option given the 
  impossibly hostile regulatory backdrop, not to mention the alternative. 
  Ignoring policy makers call to act as a broker that collects user 
  information, reports taxes, and cooperates on KYC, AML, and market 
  manipulation investigations might not be a smart position to take. 2. 
  Credible decentralization. In light of the regulatory situation, it's 
  healthy to cleanly separate Uniswap Labs from the protocol it helps 
  spawn, as well as the Uniswap Foundation. Though you could see how this 
  all would be confusing, right, the UNI supply that was initially 
  distributed to the labs and foundation entities and their teams and 
  investors has mostly vested three opt-outs are available. Users can opt 
  out from using the Uniswap front-end if they so choose, and leverage 
  aggregators like 1-inch or 0x is matcha. Yes, the defaults will matter 
  for most users, but this still seems okay. And it's incumbent on new 
  entities, particularly those operating internationally, to compete away 
  Uniswap Labs incumbent advantage with a better product. The projects I'm
   watching most closely in the aggregator space are 0x, which has now 
  caught and surpassed its top competitor and 1-inch after settling 
  charges with the CFTC. Solana DEX aggregator Jupiter is interesting for 
  another reason. Solana traders are opting to use the community's leading
   aggregator in greater percentages than the leading DEX orca. This could
   be a hint of things to come as interfaces add additional value on top 
  of the on-chain protocols they route transactions to. With additional 
  tooling like Uniswap X or Jupiter's DCA tool, interfaces can win 
  customer acquisition battles and capture value. 8.3 payments. Could this
   be the year that lightning finally takes off while I don't like making a
   habit out of betting against people like David Marcus. After five years
   of development, I would have expected the lighting network to have more
   capacity than Terra Classic USD. But USTC post-Luna collapse is still 
  twice as large. There are some other killer payments protocols coming 
  live that will change how we transfer crypto as a 10x improved payment 
  system versus the traditional banking rails. The new functionality these
   protocols provide can be broadly categorized as streams, continuous 
  real-time micro payments for content subscriptions, token vesting, etc. 
  splits, smart distributed payments amongst a group of recipients 
  according to predefined logic like royalties and smart payments, 
  abstraction layers that handle complex payment logic on behalf of users.
   Basically all the companies raising tons of VC funding, sphere decent 
  Solana pay. These are the tools that AI agents and depend networks will 
  use to pay one another, not JP Morgan, and they serve as the financial 
  backbone for new types of D-SOC networks, Lenzv2, where synergistic 
  actions between users are rewarded with programmatic payments. 
  Investment in the space fell to just under 500 million after 6.5 billion
   poured in the previous three years. That is a return to normalcy, not 
  the death of the business. 8.4 on-chain perps. This year, DEX spot 
  volumes averaged around 15% of CEX volumes with Uniswap leading the way.
   But when it comes to futures and perpetuals, the lifeblood of the C5 
  markets with 70% of all trading volumes, DEX market share is an order of
   magnitude smaller, averaging between just 1.5 to 2.0%. DYDX is even 
  more dominant than Uniswap with 70% plus market share in its sector, and
   a big year upcoming in 2024 with its V4 upgrade. DYDX has been one of 
  the most popular DeFi applications on Ethereum, leveraging Starquares L2
   Infra for its platform, which by itself is currently the fifth largest 
  roll-up by TVL. That capacity should increase with the migration to DYDX
   V4 after the project launched its own customized standalone Cosmos 
  chain in October. The DYDX central limit order book model more closely 
  reflects the trading experience most perps traders are familiar with, so
   odds are good that DYDX can close some of the market share gap with CFI
   given the stresses those mostly offshore platforms have been dealing 
  with amidst an ongoing regulatory crackdown. The market already took 
  note of the opportunity for DYDX this year among DEX tokens over a 
  hundred non-dollar million dollar in market cap. It's been the third 
  best performer behind only 0x in orca after notching a 170% gain through
   the end of November. The only things holding back DYDX are a successful
   migration of its markets to V4 and its still significant token 
  overhang. Just 42% of its token supply is outstanding today. Aside from 
  the Solana DEXs, Drift and Jupiter in particular, one major alternative 
  to watch is DYOG synthetics. Its Andromeda release is upcoming, will 
  introduce cross-margin functionality, support multiple new collateral 
  types, and a range of other trading improvements, access controls, 
  liquidation improvements, etc. Plus an attractive change to the SNX 
  tokens fee share dynamics. It trades at a third of DYDX's fully diluted 
  valuation and was the fourth best DEX performer YTD. If you're going to 
  watch one sector in DeFi this year, it should be the Perp-DEX. 8.5 DeFi 
  lending. The CFI lending markets wreaked havoc on crypto in 2022 and 
  their disastrous effects on the centralized lending market plus rapidly 
  increasing interest rates had spillover effects in the DeFi lending 
  markets. But things are slowly coming back and I'm not sure I can be 
  friends with you if you don't think that the top 10 DeFi protocols in 
  aggregate will still be worth less than the world's 216th largest bank 
  by market cap in five years. Cinnovus. If anything DeFi lending is the 
  one sector where you can win thrice, one, the trend towards real world 
  asset tokenization is mostly captured in two areas. Yield bearing stable
   coin holdings at exchanges like Coinbase and DeFi lending protocols. 
  For example, maker's reserve composition has shifted towards tokenized 
  treasuries up from 40 million in mid 2022 to nearly $3 billion today. 
  Two, they're safer than CFI lending services because they're more 
  transparent and easier to scale globally. They held up well versus their
   CFI counterparts amidst the Luna FTX and SVB crises over that 
  tumultuous 12 month period and have kept on ticking without much 
  fanfare. Three, LSTs have become a popular collateral type for MKR 
  constituting 26% of deposits. As more DeFi native investors seek to 
  juice their yields, having an interest bearing collateral like Lido's 
  Steth backing a maker vault will further widen the spread between the 
  attractiveness of CFI and DeFi loans. Security concerns, rug pulls, 
  oracle attacks, bridge hacks, etc. remain an issue, but DeFi gets more 
  anti-fragile over time and the OG protocols have a Lindy effect. Maker 
  in particular feels like a value investor dream to the extent any tradfi
   investors look to deploy to liquid crypto markets beyond the major 
  network tokens. MKR now trades at a forward PE of 13ish, simply 
  incredible. Avi's TVL is up 80% YTD too, driven by adoption of Aave V3 
  and the proliferation of LSTs as collateral assets this year. Aave V3 
  introduced a new efficiency mode that allows higher loan-to-value ratios
   for correlated tokens like ETH and Steth further juicing, staking 
  yields. It hasn't been all sunshine and rainbows. Aave's long-awaited 
  stablecoin, expected to be a big revenue driver and new business model 
  for the money market businesses, stumbled out of the gates, but this is 
  hardly a stagnating project. 8.6 LSTs. Liquid staking tokens, LSTs are 
  yield-bearing IOUs issued by liquid staking protocols and have become 
  the largest DeFi sector by TVL. I covered Ethereum's liquid staking 
  derivative juggernaut LEDO in the products to watch section as that 
  might be interesting for the tradfi folks and new entrants reading this 
  report. But LEDO is an obvious pick for anyone who's deep in the crypto 
  weeds and who understands Ethereum's emerging liquid staking derivatives
   market. Ethereum's liquid staking market has only existed in a fully 
  functional environment for a handful of months. Before April, ETH could 
  be delegated to a third-party validator in return for a liquid staking 
  token that would serve as an IOU for the contracts underlying staked 
  ETH, but it wasn't fully redeemable. LEDO's sth was effectively the 
  on-chain equivalent of GBTC in that regard. The Chappella upgrade in 
  April marked a significant milestone for Ethereum by enabling staking 
  withdrawals from the Ethereum staking contract. This resulted in 
  substantial inflow into ETH staking as many Ethereum investors had been 
  awaiting the opportunity to stake their assets with the assurance of 
  full redeemability and the flexibility to withdraw at any time. Multiple
   catalysts still remain for liquid staking. Today, alluvial and Ether.Fi
   are creating unique LST offerings and more are working to incorporate 
  distributed validator technology, DBT, to make their staking products, 
  and Ethereum staking itself more robust. Liquid staking tokens are a 
  multi-billion-dollar industry that supports the security of Ethereum, 
  Solana, and other L1s. Liquid staking on Ethereum has a TVL of $15 
  billion with 28 million ETH staked and a 3.7% staking yield staking 
  services collectively generate revenues of 2.3 billion. It's an enormous
   market with the potential to grow further. And I've come around on 
  staking issuance revenue being real in Ethereum rather than a form of 
  stock dividend thanks to the limitations on the growth of network 
  validators to be imposed by EIP 75114. The greatest opportunity for 
  liquid staking protocols will be in 2024 and the years ahead. If a BTC 
  spot ETF gets approved, can ETH be far behind? A trad-fi giants are 
  already tripping over themselves to get Gary's approval. And once it is 
  approved, a staked ETH ETF is not much of a leap. A native yield-bearing
   asset with no inflation home to the future of finance and the digital 
  consumer economy and being carbon neutral on top. The investment pitch 
  practically writes itself. But yes, liquid staking could destroy the 
  network with validation delays thanks to a larger number of validators 
  that must communicate to form consensus. And ETH holding disincentives, 
  if LST liquidity eclipses ETH liquidity, disincentives to hold ETH may 
  cause unpredictable outcomes. But the birth of new products like 
  Eigenlayer, a restaking primitive that enables Ethereum stakers to use 
  their staked ETH to secure additional networks creates counterbalances. 
  Note, Vitalik has discussed his thoughts on L2s and restaking protocols 
  and exporting demand for protocol security and essential factor in layer
   one value accrual at length. Liquid staking tokens, LSTs are having a 
  transformative effect across the DeFi ecosystem too. LST deposits have 
  accounted for effectively all of the growth in Aave deposits this year 
  and now represent the majority of all lending activity in the protocol. 
  Maker is following a similar path with liquid staking deposits 
  surpassing ETH as collateral stablecoins in RWAs still represent the 
  plurality of collateral assets. And the new LST-backed stablecoin market
   is now exploding amassing a 400k ETH in staked assets so far this year.
   LST finance had a moment in 2023 but it is likely only the beginning. 
  The nearly one billion-diked TVL in these protocols is yield-bearing 
  assets. Yield is the lifeblood of finance and these protocols unlock a 
  new sustainable yield source for DeFi. Pendle, the native token of the 
  yield trading protocol, was one of the best performing assets in 2023 up
   over 2000%. Projects like Athena and Prisma are still early in their 
  stablecoin development and have the potential to bring new exciting 
  solutions to LSTFI. Will we have a LEDO in every POS network pot? 
  Probably GEDO, a combination of flashbots for Solana. They build 
  themselves as an MEV infrastructure project and LEDO for Solana, liquid 
  staking for Solana, just dropped a mammoth airdrop to its users in early
   December and may very well be the project that sets off Solana DeFi's 
  winter summer. Expect leading LSTs on other networks to follow suit. 8.7
   bridges and messengers. Cross-chain bridges have been a disaster for us
   over the past few years. When it comes to crypto's narrative 
  vulnerabilities, bridges are behind only centralized exchange frauds as 
  our biggest and most damaging black eyes. The $600 million Ronan and 
  Poly network hacks, $300 million wormhole hack and $200 million Nomad 
  hack among others have accounted for nearly half of the $5.7 billion 
  dollars in hacks over the past six years in DeFi.
