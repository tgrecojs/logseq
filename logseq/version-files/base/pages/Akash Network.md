## Akash Insiders Meeting with Adam Wozney
id:: 656d6d07-69d9-4d9e-bcd2-a7cc89c37700
	- Apologies for thinking this was only a 5-10 minute thing! I really didn’t grasp the scope of the meeting until after looking through the akash insiders page so my fault.
	- ### Meeting Prep Notes
		- Education SIG
			- Led by Adam.
			- GitHub Page - https://github.com/akash-network/community/tree/main/sig-education
		- **Notes**
			- This seems like something I might benefit from being looped in on.
			- I already outlined my plans for the initial videos:
				- following through the docs and making video content that mirrors each section.
			- This meeting seems like it explores the education realm in a bit more depth. Said differently, it seems like this meeting creates a platform for exploring some new, interesting ways in which akash contributors could help onboard users to the platform that don’t currently exist.
- ## December 5th Docs WG
