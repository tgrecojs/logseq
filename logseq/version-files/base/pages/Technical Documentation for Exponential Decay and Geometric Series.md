## Technical Documentation: Exponential Decay and Geometric Series
- ### Overview
  
  This document explains the concepts of exponential decay and geometric series in a way that is easy to understand, even for someone with a basic understanding of math. It also provides relevant formulas and JavaScript code samples to demonstrate these behaviors. Additionally, it addresses whether the concepts of "exponential decay" and "geometric series" are equivalent.
- ### What is Exponential Decay?
  
  **Exponential Decay** refers to a process where the quantity or value decreases at a rate proportional to its current value. This means that as time progresses, the rate of decrease diminishes.
- **Visual Example:** Imagine you have a pile of sand, and you remove a fixed percentage of the sand each day. You start with a lot of sand, but as days go by, you remove less and less sand each day because the pile is getting smaller.
- ### Mathematical Formula for Exponential Decay
  
  The formula to calculate the decayed value is:
  $$
  a_n = a_1 \cdot r^{(n-1)}
  $$
  
  Where:
- \( a_n \) = Value at the nth period (e.g., day)
- \( a_1 \) = Initial value (value at day 1)
- \( r \) = Decay factor (a number between 0 and 1 indicating the rate of decay)
- \( n \) = Period number (e.g., day number)
- ### What is a Geometric Series?
  
  A **Geometric Series** is a series of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous one by a fixed, non-zero number called the "common ratio."
- **Visual Example:** Suppose you start with 100 and multiply it by 0.5 (or divide by 2) repeatedly. You'll get a sequence: 100, 50, 25, 12.5, ...
- ### Mathematical Formula for Geometric Series
  
  The sum of the first \( n \) terms of a geometric series is given by:
  $$
  S_n = a_1 \cdot \frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r}
  $$
  
  Where:
- \( S_n \) = Sum of the first \( n \) terms
- \( a_1 \) = First term in the series
- \( r \) = Common ratio (same as decay factor in exponential decay)
- \( n \) = Number of terms
- ### Are Exponential Decay and Geometric Series Equivalent?
  
  In essence, exponential decay and the geometric series involve similar concepts. While exponential decay refers to the decreasing process of a value over time, a geometric series represents the sum of values generated by a fixed ratio. The repeated multiplication by a fixed ratio in both cases makes these concepts interrelated, but they are not exactly the same. Exponential decay focuses on the reduction process, while geometric series focuses on the sequence and sum of terms.
- ### JavaScript Code Samples
- #### Exponential Decay
  
  Let's demonstrate exponential decay with a JavaScript function that calculates the decayed value over a series of days:
  
  ```javascript
  const exponentialDecay = (initialValue, decayFactor, periods) => {
  let values = [];
  for(let day = 1; day <= periods; day++) {
    let value = initialValue * Math.pow(decayFactor, day - 1);
    values.push(value);
  }
  return values;
  };
  
  // Example usage:
  let initialValue = 1000;  // Initial value on the first day
  let decayFactor = 0.8;    // Decay factor: 80%
  let periods = 5;          // Number of days
  
  console.log(exponentialDecay(initialValue, decayFactor, periods));
  // Output: [ 1000, 800, 640, 512, 409.6 ]
  ```
- #### Geometric Series
  
  Below is a JavaScript function to calculate the sum of the first n terms of a geometric series:
  
  ```javascript
  const geometricSeriesSum = (firstTerm, commonRatio, terms) => {
  return firstTerm * (1 - Math.pow(commonRatio, terms)) / (1 - commonRatio);
  };
  
  // Example usage:
  let firstTerm = 1000;       // First term in the series
  let commonRatio = 0.8;      // Common ratio: 80%
  let terms = 5;              // Number of terms
  
  console.log(geometricSeriesSum(firstTerm, commonRatio, terms)); 
  // Output: 3362.24
  ```
- ### Summary
- **Exponential Decay** is a process where a value decreases over time by a constant proportion.
- **Geometric Series** is a series of numbers multiplied by a fixed ratio.
- While related through the use of a common ratio, they represent different mathematical concepts.
- JavaScript code samples demonstrate how to calculate values based on these concepts.
  
  These explanations and code samples should help you understand and apply exponential decay and geometric series in practical scenarios.
