## Overview
	- Diataxis is a methodology for writing documentation.
	- It's a user-centric approach.
	- Employs the belief that **documentation must serve it users.** Those writing the documentation must understand that goal users seek to accomplish.
	- Users are **pracitioners in a domain of skill.**
	- A domain can range in size.
		- Learning how to use a open-source React library.
		- Learning JavaScript.
	- ### Two Dimensions of Craft
		- > The following dimensions lie the foundations for Diaxis.
		- #### Action + Cognition
			- Doing + Knowing
		- **Acquistion + Application**
			- Acquiring knowledge + Applying knowledge
		- **Map of the territory of craft**
