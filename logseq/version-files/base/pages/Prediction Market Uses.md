	- #### Summary
	- Prediction Markets (PMs) can do more than predict the future. First, the mere presence of a PM based forecast can conclusively end debates, prevent lies, encourage and protect whistleblowers, and provide decision makers with honest advice.
	- Secondly, PMs have applications altogether beyond forecasting: through creative use of the tradable shares, one can provide financial services such as risk-management, insurance, retirement portfolios, recreational gambling, etc.
	- Finally, I discuss five ‘Big Ideas’ for cryptocurrency PMs.

- ## Main Points
	- Prediction markets can do more than predict the future
	- They can end debates, prevent lies, encourage whistleblowers, and provide honest advice
	- They can also provide financial services such as risk management, insurance, retirement portfolios, and gambling
	- Five 'Big Ideas' for cryptocurrency prediction markets are discussed: decentralized governance for hard forks, stable fiat-value crypto-assets, SPV-compatible colored coins, provision of public goods without taxation or third-parties, and smart contracts and decentralized applications
	- Prediction markets can put an end to public confusion on issues where evidence will eventually settle
	- Prediction markets can expose lies and drain the bank accounts of liars
	- Prediction markets can be used for event futures, separating buyers into users and speculators
	- Prediction markets can be used to fund public goods without trust or taxes
	- Blockchain smart contracts can be used in prediction markets for various purposes
	- The document discusses specific examples and details for each of these points
