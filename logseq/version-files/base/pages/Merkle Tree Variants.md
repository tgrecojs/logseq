- ## 1. Merkle Tree
	- ### Introduction
		- A Merkle Tree, also known as a Hash Tree, is a tree structure in which every leaf node is labeled with the cryptographic hash of a data block, and every non-leaf node is labeled with the cryptographic hash of the labels of its child nodes.
	- ### Structure
		- **Leaf Nodes:** Contain the hash of individual data blocks.
		- **Non-Leaf Nodes:** Contain the hash of the concatenation of their child nodes' hashes.
		- **Root Node (Merkle Root):** Represents the combined hash of all the leaf nodes and verifies the integrity of the entire data set.
	- ### Properties
		- **Integrity Verification:** Root hash can be used to verify the integrity of any individual data block.
			- **Efficiency:** Proof of inclusion or exclusion of an element requires only $$O(\log n)$$ hashes.
		- **Immutability:** Changing any data block requires recomputation of hashes up to the Merkle root.
	- ### Diagram Example
	  
	  ```
	        Root Hash
	           / \
	     Hash0-1  Hash2-3
	     /   \     /   \
	  Hash0  Hash1  Hash2  Hash3
	  /  \   /  \  /  \   /  \
	  D0   D1 D2  D3 D4  D5 D6  D7
	  ```

- ## 2. Incremental Merkle Tree
	- ### Introduction
		- An Incremental Merkle Tree is an extension of the Merkle Tree that allows efficient updates and additions of new elements without reconstructing the entire tree.
	- ### Structure
		- **Dynamic Leaf Insertion:** New leaves can be added incrementally.
		- **Dynamic Hash Updates:** Non-leaf nodes are recalculated efficiently when new leaves are added.
	- ### Properties
		- **Efficient Updates:** Only $$O(\log n)$$ hashes need to be recalculated when a new element is added.
		- **Cost-effective:** Lower computational and storage overhead for integrating new data.
	- ### Use Cases
		- **Blockchain:** Efficiently adding new transactions to a Merkle Tree-based block.
		- **Databases:** Incrementally adding new records to a data structure that ensures data integrity.
		- ### Diagram Example
		- Each time a new data block (e.g., D8) is added:
		- Before:
		- ```
		        Root Hash
		           / \
		     Hash0-1  Hash2-3
		     /   \     /   \
		  Hash0  Hash1  Hash2  Hash3
		  /  \   /  \  /  \   /  \
		  D0   D1 D2  D3 D4  D5 D6  D7
		  ```
		  After:
		  ```
		              Root Hash' 
		           /                \
		        Root Hash        Hash8        
		           / \               |
		     Hash0-1  Hash2-3       D8  
		     /   \     /   \
		  Hash0  Hash1  Hash2  Hash3
		  /  \   /  \  /  \   /  \
		  D0   D1 D2  D3 D4  D5 D6  D7
		  ```

- ## 3. Merkle Mountain Range
	- ### Introduction
		- A Merkle Mountain Range (MMR) is a data structure that allows for efficient appending and proving of data in an ordered sequence.
	- ### Structure
		- **Range of Merkle Trees:** Composed of multiple Merkle Trees, creating a "mountain range."
		- **Appending:** New data is added by creating the smallest possible new tree or extending the smallest tree.
	- ### Properties
		- **Continuous Appending:** Supports continuous appending of new elements.
		- **Efficient Proofs:** Efficiently proves the inclusion of elements with minimal extra storage.
	- ### Use Cases
		- **Blockchain:** Used in UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) implementations for efficiently verifying transaction histories.
		- **Data Chains:** Ensuring data integrity in ordered data sequences over time.
	- ### Diagram Example
	  
	  ```
	  MMR of 7 elements:
	  Mountain 2 (tree of size 4)
	    __H___
	   /     \
	  H1     H2
	  / \    / \

	     H5
	    /
	   D7
	  ```
	  
	  Adding one more element:
	  ```
	  MMR of 8 elements:
	  Mountain 3 (tree of size 8)
	        __H__
	       /     \
	    __H      __H__
	   /   \    /     \

- ## 4. Merkle Sum Tree
- ### Introduction
	- A Merkle Sum Tree is a variant of the Merkle Tree where each node contains both a cryptographic hash and an additional value representing the sum of data in that subtree.
- ### Structure
	- **Leaf Nodes:** Contain the hash of the data and the value of the data block.
	- **Non-Leaf Nodes:** Contain the hash of their child nodes' hashes and the sum of their child nodes' values.
- ### Properties
	- **Sum Aggregation:** Each node effectively stores an aggregated sum for efficient verification of accumulated values.
	- **Integrity and Value Verification:** Verifies both the data's integrity and accumulated value across the tree.
- ### Use Cases
	- **Cryptocurrencies:** Used for balancing transactions and ensuring total value integrity.
	- **Accounting Systems:** Verifying combined totals of nested financial data.
- ### Diagram Example
  
  ```
          Root Hash, Sum (36)
           /         \
   Hash0-1, 10     Hash2-3, 26

	- **Default Hashes:** Use default values for non-existent nodes to save space.
- ### Properties
	- **Efficient Proofs:** Supports efficient proofs for both inclusion and non-inclusion of data.
	- **Space-Efficient:** Avoids storage of non-existent nodes, using default values instead.
	- **Simplified Updates:** Adding and updating elements can be efficiently managed with recursive hash updates.
- ### Use Cases
- **Blockchain Systems:** Especially useful for verifying state changes (e.g., Ethereum 2.0 state verification).
- **Large Key Spaces:** Ideal for IoT or log systems with a vast potential key space but sparse population.
