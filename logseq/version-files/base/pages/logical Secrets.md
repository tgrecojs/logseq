## Abstract
	- Cryptograhy is only necessary for implementing authentication operations **in the abscense of a mutually trusted secure substrate.**
	- ## Work Plan
	- Implement a public-key system that **derives security from encapsulation rather than encryption.**
	- > Concurrent Logic Programming languages provide such a substrate.

	- ### Intro
		- Two of the issues in security are secrecy and authentication.
		- Capability operating systems and languages with strict encapsulation alrtleady provide this for two-party interactions. Providing secure three-party communication is more demanding.
		- 3 Party Authentication
			- passing a message through to an untrusted intermediary

		- Three-party secrecy
			- is the ability to pass a message through an untrusted intermediary to an intended recipient in such a way that **only the intended recipient may read the message.**
		- Three party authentication
			- the ability to pass a message through an untrusted intermediary to an intended recipient so that the message contents cannot be faked while preserving the appearance of the original authorship. This corresponds to hu
		- Secrecy vs Authentication
			- Secrecy keeps the message private from others.
			- Auth refers to preserving the identity of a signature.
		- authenticated messages constitute proof to third parties that some transaction occurred.
		- The security features which are crucially important to the current approach are:
			- strict encapsulation (the ability to provide a service based on access to private data while denying that access to oneâ€™s clients), capability security, and non-forgeable unique identifiers.
	- ### PK Comms
		- PK securiy based on unique key pairs that encrypt and decrept data.
		- Sealing and unsealing are
