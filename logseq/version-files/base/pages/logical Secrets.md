## Abstract
	- Cryptograhy is only necessary for implementing authentication operations **in the abscense of a mutually trusted secure substrate.**
	- ## Work Plan
	- Implement a public-key system that **derives security from encapsulation rather than encryption.**
	- > Concurrent Logic Programming languages provide such a substrate.

	- ### Intro
		- Two of the issues in security are secrecy and authentication.
		- Capability operating systems and languages with strict encapsulation already provide this for two-party interactions. Providing secure three-party communication is more demanding.
		- 3 Party Authentication

		- Three-party secrecy
			- is the ability to pass a message through an untrusted intermediary to an intended recipient in such a way that only the intended recipient may read the message.
		- Three party authentication
			- the ability to pass a message through an untrusted intermediary to an intended recipient so that the message contents cannot be faked while preserving the appearance of the origiÂ¬ nal authorship. This corresponds to hu
