- ### tl;dr
	- A Powerbox is an object with extensive authority. At minimum, it must hold all the authority that any of the applications it might service might need.
	- At a minimum it must hold all the authority that any of the applications it might service might need.
	- **The powerbox is a composition of objects that grants, revokes, negotiates, and in general manages, the authorities granted to another object.**

- ## History:
	- The powerbox pattern was invented during the development of CapDesk and the DarpaBrowser; the experiences with building both a good (secure and flexible) powerbox and a poor (rigid yet breachable) powerbox led to a better understanding of the concept.
- ## Overview
	- The object to which a powerbox is assigned lies on the far side of a trust boundary, and the authorities for the differently-trusted object vary dynamically, at least on a session basis, or even during the session.
		- Powerbox is on the trusted side.
		- The powerbox must equip objects with whatever resources they need to properly carry out their job.
		- An object can have varying authority throughout its lifecycle. An object that sends a message to an API each time a program
		- To fulfill its job, an object may require
		- objects can change throughout an object's lifecycle.
		- New capabilities may be needed
		- object continues, capabilities
	- The powerbox itself must have extensive authority. As a minimum it must hold all the authority that any of the applications it might service might need. The powerbox then dynamically doles out these authorities based on POLA, to the actual instantiated application.
	- ### The Role of the Powerbox in Delegating Authority
		- > A Powerbox is an object with extensive authority.
		- The powerbox itself **must have extensive authority.**
			- At a minimum **it must hold all the authority that any of the applications it might service might need**. The powerbox then dynamically doles out these authorities based on POLA, to the actual instantiated (live) application (objects).
		- Powersboxes can be dynamic
			- As mentioned above, **the acts of a powerbox passing out authority (mentioned above) is an on-going process.** In some instances, a Powerbox may receive a request for a capability that it does itself not in possession of a capability object that exists within its system requests a reference for a capability that the Powerbox itself does not possess
			- The powerbox even negotiates with the user on the applicationâ€™s behalf for additional authorities if the application finds itself unable to fulfill its obligations without more powers.
- ## Powerbox Construction
	- Modules in a powerbox
		- `powerbox`
			- contains all of the authorities that one would ever need to carry out a task.
			- in addition to holding these authorities, it is responsible for ensuring that an object is provided with the permissions it needs to function properly.
		- `main` module (start function)
			- the root module of a program.
			- it is through the `main` module that objects receive the permissions they need.
			- example - e-mail client
				- address book has the authority to read from the address-book file.
				- the renderer only has authority to the `document` API (assuming that the user-interface is being rendered within its own confined, frozen Compartment).
			- example - Native Application - card deck shuffler
