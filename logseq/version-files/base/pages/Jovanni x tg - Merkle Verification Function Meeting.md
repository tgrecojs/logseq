- # Summary
- ## Project Development, Agoric, and JavaScript
	- jovonni and Thomas discussed the intricacies and development of their current project, acknowledging the significant amount of work that has gone into it. They also compared their project to Agoric, highlighting the decades of work that have gone into developing the underlying technologies. Furthermore, they shared their experiences and perspectives on JavaScript development, emphasizing the complexity and depth of the tech stack and the significant differences between writing JavaScript and designing new features for the language. Lastly, they discussed the history of the ES programming language and its development, underscoring the value of being humble and learning from others.
- ## Discussing Agoric Challenges and TDD
	- Thomas and jovonni discussed their experiences with Eric Elliott, a JavaScript expert and former mentor of Thomas. They also talked about the challenges they faced while working with Agoric, a testing framework. Thomas shared his approach to testing, emphasizing the importance of understanding the system's behavior. jovonni agreed, highlighting his own experiences with Agoric and the need to understand the repo's functioning. Both expressed their preference for Test-Driven Development (TDD) and how it helps them focus and verify their solutions.
- ## Discussing Diagram and Javascript Runtime
	- jovonni presented a graphic, referred to as "one diagram to rule them all," which he believed should be made public. The diagram, created by an unnamed team member, appears to be a visual representation of the process of learning and applying knowledge, with vets and kernels as key components. Thomas expressed interest in understanding the diagram and its components, such as the device node and excess. The pair also discussed the concept of a Javascript runtime for embedded systems, with Thomas mentioning that Agoric uses this engine. jovonni agreed to study the terms "excess" and "x snap" further.
- ## System Technicalities and Message Routing
	- jovonni and Thomas discussed the technical intricacies of their system, focusing on the use of tables, the 'bad warehouse', and the 'cosmos SDK module'. They delved into the communication between the Gork vm and the cosmos SDK, and the role of the 'X swing set' in dispatching calls. jovonni clarified certain points and confirmed the system's continued operation, despite having earlier killed his environment. They also discussed the process of understanding message types and routing in the context of the Swing Set system, with jovonni explaining how to identify message types and their associated actions. Thomas, who was new to the system, found it insightful and agreed that the message server is a helpful tool.
- ## System Details and Continuous Learning
	- jovonni and Thomas discussed the intricacies of a system, with jovonni explaining various aspects such as the use of proto types, module params, and the handling of proposals. Thomas expressed his interest in understanding more about the system and mentioned his focus on Agoric for the past few years. Both agreed on the importance of continuous learning and exploration in their roles.
- ## Thomas and Jovonni's Work Experiences and Recommendations
	- Thomas and jovonni discussed their previous work experiences, with Thomas sharing his tenure at Bank of America and his subsequent journey into blockchain. Thomas also revealed his plans to build a lending platform, which was in progress when the FTX incident occurred. The pair also reminisced about their time at college and their mutual acquaintance, Patrick. The conversation concluded with jovonni bringing up a current project, Trebles, which seemed to have rekindled Thomas' interest.
- ## Airdrop, Collaboration Platform, and Merquitreat
	- Thomas introduced the concept of an airdrop as the initial phase of a collaboration platform using prediction markets. jovonni expressed interest, and it was clarified the airdrop serves as the entry point. The project is a joint effort with Zuki, with a 50k intellectual property split. Thomas and jovonni discussed ongoing work, future plans, and implementing inclusion proofs in contracts. Thomas mentioned the 'merquitreat' topic and received an action item related to it. They planned to continue the discussion later when jovonni was available, and Thomas inquired about next steps for 'merquitreat'.
- ## Verification Logic Issues in Hash Function
	- Thomas and jovonni discussed the function Thomas was writing to verify the inclusion proof against the root hash. Thomas explained the process, but highlighted that he was encountering issues with the verification logic. jovonni suggested the problem might be with the encoding part, but Thomas clarified that the issue was with the verification logic itself. Thomas offered to share his implementation with jovonni to help identify the problem. Upon further discussion, they identified that the verification was generating a different hash than the root hash, causing the verification to fail.
- ## Addressing Process Issue and Root Node
	- jovonni and Thomas addressed an issue with a process, focusing on the generation of the root node and discrepancies in data lengths. Thomas agreed to remove a problematic log statement to improve the process, and they planned to further investigate the issue, with Thomas tracing inside a certain function. Thomas agreed to work on this issue further after the call.
- ## Debugging Techniques and Collaboration Experiences
	- jovonni and Thomas focused on debugging techniques and tools, with Thomas introducing jovonni to the Agoric debugger and its usage with VS Code and the command palette. They explored the use of breakpoints and the process of adding a debugger to their test setup, successfully identifying and fixing a bug in a piece of JavaScript code. The discussion also covered the importance of collaboration in programming, with both appreciating the value of having a second set of eyes on code and sharing their positive experiences with pair programming and auditing at Certik. Thomas committed to further investigate a technical issue, and they agreed to keep each other updated on progress via Discord.
