### Type Systems
	- Decidibilty
		- can use to make a deicision
	- soundness
		- everything we can prove is true
	- completeness
- ### Supmply typed lamba
	- gamme
		- context
	- tern syle
		- ype judgement
	- sigma
		- denotes the type
-
- Polymorphic
	- for all alpha a -> a
- monoprhic
	- vairable
	- application
	- abstraction
- polymorphic
	- gamma
	- quantifier logic
-
- variables are bound
	- universally qunatified
	- appearing in function types.
- we use the instantiation rule to go from a polymorphic type to a specific type.
