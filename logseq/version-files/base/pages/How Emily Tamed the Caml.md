- ### Overview
	- Research paper by Mark Miller and Mark Steigler focused around "Emily", an OCaml subset that made the language comply with POLA best practices.
		- *Emily is a subset of OCaml that uses a design rule verifier to enforce object-capability principles. It demonstrates how memory-safe languages can be transformed into breach-resistant object-capability systems with little loss of either expressivity or performance.*
- ## Personal Notes
	- Takes an approach that is very similar to the one taken by Endo.
		- Jessie.js disallows the use of `Array.prototype.push.
		- In Emily, "hidden-but-present memory-violating functions (such as `Array.unsafe_set`) are disallowed"
	- "Providing the reference to an object must grant the permission to use the object."
	- It is not enough to just provide an application with a reference to `fs.readFile`. **In order to use `fs.readFile`, the application must hold the powers necessary to work with `fs`.**

		- ### `Sash` - "Safe Bash"
- `Sash` - "Safe Bash"
	- Powerbox for implementing safe bash commands
	- Why?
		- While we might not realize it, we often grant bash with excessive authority over our filesystem in exchange for having it carry out menial tasks.
		- `cp` vs. `sashcp`
			- `cp`
				- has read/write powers for entire filesystem on a user's computer
				- in reality, it should only be granted the read permissions at the time of use, and these permissions should only apply to the specific file (or files) the user wishes to make a copy of. Similarly, the permission to write should be granted at the time of execution, and
			- `sashcp=file1.txt+file1-copy.txt`
				- the Sash powerbox interprets this command
					- `=` grant "read" permissions to this argument
					- `+` grant read/write permissions to this arguent.

	- ### "forgery-resistant"
		- example of cli-phishing
			- program attempting to acquire the password to a user's PGP key. The attacker formats the output to present itself to the user as a gpg command processor, and uses stdin to read the passphrase, in a phishing-style attack.
		- how to mitigate this:
			- `sashcp` strips out any non-visible characters and postfixes every new line with `>`. It also ensures that newlines occur after a specific numbers of characters.
			- at the end of its execution, the user is provided with output documenting the name of the command, along with information about what has just occurred.
		- In other words, **provide users with the context they need in order to utilize programs while simultaneously demonstrating good security hygiene.**
