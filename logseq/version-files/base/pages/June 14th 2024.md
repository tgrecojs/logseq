### How SwingSet uses bundles
	- #### Bundle Processes
		- **all swingset vats, both static and dynamic, start from a bundle.**
			- in these bundles, the entry point module exports a function named buildRootObject.
		- **through ``vatAdminService~.getBundleCap()`, vat code can exchange a bundle ID for a bundlecap.**
		- **the bundlecap can be used with `vatAdminService~.createVat()` to make a new dynamic vat.**
		- **userspace can use `D(bundleCap).getBundle()` to fetch the bundle itself, for use with an `importBundle()` that does not create an entire new vat.**
			- the Zoe "ZCF" facet uses this to load contract code within an existing vat.
			- this could also be used as part of an in-vat upgrade process, to load new behavior.
		- **each vat also has a "liveslots" layer, defined by a bundle.**
			- the liveslots bundle ID is recorded separately for each vat, so liveslots can be upgraded (for new vats) without affecting the behavior of existing ones.
			- swingset devices are defined by bundles that are stored in the bundle table.
		- **the kernel source code itself is stored in a bundle, to make it easier to switch from one version of the kernel to another at a pre-determined time.**
