- can you help me work through a scenario. i would like to create a derivative product representing a 2x long position.
  we will call these "LNL" tokens - "Lounge 'n' Leverage".  The name is subject to change, however it is a great description of the service LnL token holders receive.
- LnL tokens are powered by CDP stablecoin protocol. This works similar to Maker DAO's minting process for the $DAI stablecoin.
- the protocol is "Inter Protocol" or "Inter". Inter's mechanism for minting $IST is very similiar to Maker.
- A user opens a **vault** by depositing a payment from one of the accepted collateral types
- Inter allows users to create  "vaults" using one of the protocol's accepted collateral types.
  it mints the stablecoin $IST. 
  
  stablecoin protocol
  
  The system works as follows:
- A "vault" is made on inter-protocol.
  logseq.order-list-type:: number
- $1M in $ATOM is deposited.
  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- "vault" now has ability to mint upto $50000 $IST.
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
- ### Minting LnL Tokens
  * I'd like to mint 1000 LnL tokens with each token representing the underlying collateral and debt.
