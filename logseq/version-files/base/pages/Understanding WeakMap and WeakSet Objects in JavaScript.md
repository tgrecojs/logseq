> Unlike regular Map objects, WeakMap allows the keys to be weakly referenced. This means that if there are no other references to a key object, it can be garbage-collected.

> WeakMap objects provide a level of privacy, as the keys are not enumerable, and they do not have built-in methods for size or iteration.

> WeakSet objects do not have the ability to store arbitrary values like Set objects. They are primarily used to store and manage collections of objects where the uniqueness of objects is important.
