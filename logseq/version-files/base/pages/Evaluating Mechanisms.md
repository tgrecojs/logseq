## Decay Factor Reasoning
	- The choice of decay factor \( r \) is critical to meeting specific distribution goals. The decay factor controls how the distribution of tokens decreases each day. Let's delve into the reasoning for using a decay factor of \( 0.8 \), explore other potential values, and outline criteria for choosing the best decay factor.
	- ### Reasoning Behind Using a Decay Factor of 0.8
	  
	  1. **Moderate Decrease Rate**:
		- A decay factor of \( 0.8 \) represents a moderate rate of decay, meaning that each subsequent day's allocation is reduced to 80% of the previous day's allocation.
			- This rate achieves a balance between distributing a significant number of tokens initially while ensuring a substantial reduction over the distribution period (5 days).
		- 2. **Manageable Token Allocation**:
			- With \( r = 0.8 \), each day's reduction in tokens does not create too steep a decline, ensuring that recipients receive a fair share over multiple days.
			- A balance in token distribution can help maintain the engagement of participants across all days.
		- 3. **Smooth Geometric Progression**:
			- A decay factor of \( 0.8 \) establishes a smooth geometric progression that is easy to compute and apply.
	- ### Exploring Other Values
	  
	  Other decay factors can be used to achieve different distribution behaviors. Let's explore a few alternatives:
	  
	  1. **Higher Decay Factor (Closer to 1)**:
		- Example: \( r = 0.9 \)
		- **Effect**: Slower decay with a more gradual reduction in daily tokens.
		- **Use Case**: When the goal is to maintain higher token allocations across the days, providing more balanced daily distributions.
		  
		  2. **Lower Decay Factor (Closer to 0)**:
		- Example: \( r = 0.5 \)
		- **Effect**: Faster decay with a significant reduction in daily tokens.
		- **Use Case**: When the goal is to reward early participants more heavily. Day 1 participants receive significantly more tokens than later days.
	- ### Criteria for Determining the Best Decay Factor
	  
	  1. **Distribution Goals**:
		- **Front-Loaded vs. Even Distribution**: Decide whether the goal is to distribute more tokens early (front-loaded) or to have a more even distribution across the days.
		- **Reward Consistency**: Consider if the participants should receive consistent rewards over the days or if there's a need to incentivize early claims.
		  
		  2. **Audience Engagement**:
		- **Participant Behavior**: Understand how the decay factor impacts participant engagement. A steep decay may lead to rush participation on the first day, whereas a gentler decay may sustain engagement across all days.
		  
		  3. **Total Tokens and Number of Days**:
		- Adjust the decay factor based on the total token supply and the number of distribution days. Longer distribution periods may benefit from smaller decay factors to avoid running out of tokens too quickly.
		  
		  4. **Mathematical Constraints**:
		- Ensure that the chosen decay factor causes the total token distribution to match the available supply over the specified days.
	- ### Calculating Other Decay Factors
	- #### Example: Decay Factor \( r = 0.9 \)
	- For \( r = 0.9 \):
		- The tokens for each day would reduce more slowly than with \( r = 0.8 \).
		  
		  Using the previous example (Tier 1, 1,000 individuals, 5,000,000 tokens):
		  
		  1. Calculate \( a_1 \) with \( r = 0.9 \):
		  
		  For \( r = 0.9 \):
		  $$
		  S_5 = a_1 \cdot \frac{1 - 0.9^5}{1 - 0.9} = a_1 \cdot 4.0951
		  $$
		  $$
		  5,000,000 = 1,000 \cdot a_1 \cdot 4.0951
		  $$
		  $$
		  a_1 = \frac{5,000,000}{1,000 \cdot 4.0951} \approx 1,220.17
		  $$
		  
		  2. Tokens Each Day (approximate values with \( a_1 = 1,220.17 \)):
	- Day 1: \( 1,220.17 \)
	- Day 2: \( 1,220.17 \cdot 0.9 \approx 1,098.15 \)
	- Day 3: \( 1,098.15 \cdot 0.9 \approx 988.3335 \)
	- Day 4: \( 988.3335 \cdot 0.9 \approx 889.50 \)
	- Day 5: \( 889.50 \cdot 0.9 \approx 800.55 \)
	- ### Conclusion
		- Using a decay factor of \( 0.8 \) provides a balanced and moderate rate of decay suitable for many scenarios. However, different factors like participant behavior, engagement goals, and the desired rate of token distribution can suggest the use of different decay factors. A higher \( r \) may maintain token attractiveness over the distribution period, while a lower \( r \) better incentivizes early participation. The best choice depends on the specific objectives and constraints of the token distribution plan.

- ### Detailed Distribution Strategy
- #### Desired Properties
	- 1. **Distribution Duration**:
		- xThe strategy will take place over five days.
	- 2. **Even Distribution with Incentives**:
		- We aim for a distribution mechanism that avoids a sharp decrease in supply either at the campaign's start or end.
		- We also incorporate incentives to encourage early claims.
	- 3. **Token Supply**:
		- The total token supply will range from 10 to 20 million to ensure scarcity.
	- 4. **Incentivizing Early Claims**:
		- To incentivize early claims, we will include a decay rate that modestly decreases daily token allocations.
		- Additionally, a "bonus mint" event is planned to further encourage prompt participation.
- #### Decay Factor Considerations
	- Based on your goals for even distribution with early incentive, we will use a modest decay factor, say \( r = 0.85 \), to balance the even token allocation and incentivized early participation.
- ### Distribution Mechanics
	- #### Step 1: Initial Token Allocation
		- We'll allocate the total token supply equally among the 5 tiers.
		- **Example Token Supply**: 15,000,000
		- **Tokens per Tier**: \( \text{Total Tokens} / 5 = 15,000,000 / 5 = 3,000,000 \)
	- #### Step 2: Calculation of Daily Tokens
		- Using the decay formula:
			- $$
			  a_n = a_1 \cdot 0.85^{(n-1)}
			  $$
		- Where \( a_n \) is the number of tokens available on day \( n \). The total allocation for each individual is:
			- $$
			  S_5 = a_1 \cdot \frac{1 - 0.85^5}{1 - 0.85}
			  $$
		- For 3,000,000 tokens distributed to 1,000 individuals in Tier 1:
			- $$
			  3,000,000 = 1,000 \cdot a_1 \cdot 3.953
			  $$
			  $$
			  a_1 = \frac{3,000,000}{1,000 \cdot 3.953} \approx 759.19
			  $$
	- #### Step 3: Tokens Claimable Each Day
		- For each tier, tokens claimable per individual:
		- | Day | Tokens (Tier 1)  | Tokens (Tier 2)  | Tokens (Tier 3)  | Tokens (Tier 4)   | Tokens (Tier 5)  |
		  |-----|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
		  | 1   | 759.19           | 151.84           | 75.92            | 18.98            | 7.59             |
		  | 2   | 759.19 × 0.85 ≈ 645.32 | 151.84 × 0.85 ≈ 129.06 | 75.92 × 0.85 ≈ 64.53 | 18.98 × 0.85 ≈ 16.13 | 7.59 × 0.85 ≈ 6.45  |
		  | 3   | 645.32 × 0.85 ≈ 548.52 | 129.06 × 0.85 ≈ 109.71 | 64.53 × 0.85 ≈ 54.85 | 16.13 × 0.85 ≈ 13.71 | 6.45 × 0.85 ≈ 5.48  |
		  | 4   | 548.52 × 0.85 ≈ 466.24 | 109.71 × 0.85 ≈ 93.25  | 54.85 × 0.85 ≈ 46.62  | 13.71 × 0.85 ≈ 11.65 | 5.48 × 0.85 ≈ 4.66   |
		  | 5   | 466.24 × 0.85 ≈ 396.30  | 93.25 × 0.85 ≈ 79.26 | 46.62 × 0.85 ≈ 39.63  | 11.65 × 0.85 ≈ 9.90 | 4.66 × 0.85 ≈ 3.96    |
- ### Bonus Mint Event
	- 5% of total tokens set aside for bonuses.
	- 2. **Trigger Conditions**:
		- If a certain threshold of claims is met within an epoch, initiate a bonus mint.
		- An epoch could be defined as a week or another time frame.
	- 3. **Reward Distribution**:
		- Bonus adds 1% of the token supply.
		- Half of this 1% is distributed to users who met the claim target retroactively.
- ### Refined Example Calculation
	- #### Total Token Supply = 15,750,000
	- **Main Pool**: 15,000,000 for base distribution.
	- **Bonus Pool**: 750,000 (5% of 15,000,000).
		- If the total of bonus events reached 5%:
		- 1. **Epoch Token Supply Increase**:
			- From 15,000,000 to \( 15,000,000 \times 1.01 = 15,150,000 \) per bonus event.
		- 2. **Bonus Distribution**:
			- Half of \( 150,000 \) (from 1% increase) = \( 75,000 \) distributed to eligible early claimants.
- ### Input on the Approach
- #### Pros:
	- **Balanced Distribution**: Decay factor \( 0.85 \) balances even distribution with incentivized early claims.
	- **Engagement Incentives**: Bonus mint rewards frequent participation and early engagement.
	- **Scalability**: Mechanism adaptable for different total token supplies and participant numbers.
- #### Considerations for Improvement:
	- **Adaptive Epochs**: Adjust epoch lengths dynamically based on participant activity to ensure consistent engagement.
	- **Dynamic Bonus**: Vary bonus percentages based on participation rates to maintain high engagement levels.
	- **Participant Feedback**: Regularly gather user feedback to refine the strategy, ensuring it aligns with participant expectations.
- ### Final Approach Sign-Off
	- The proposed distribution strategy, considering even distribution, moderate decay, incentivized early claims, and a bonus mint mechanism, aligns well with your desired properties and goals. This strategy should effectively balance token scarcity, encourage prompt participation, and sustain user engagement throughout the distribution period.
