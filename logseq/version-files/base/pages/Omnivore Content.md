		- > In the Tendermint consensus, the light client protocol allows clients to benefit from the same degree of security that full nodes benefit from, while bandwidth requirements are minimized. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/good-to-know-dev-terms-developer-portal-18be10ae1b2#2eb41bb6-ffb6-410d-bc20-403791caf0c8)
		- > A client can receive cryptographic proofs for blockchain states and transactions without having to sync all blocks or even their headers. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/good-to-know-dev-terms-developer-portal-18be10ae1b2#8a7b4160-3900-431d-96eb-dac36d91920a)
		- > The **light client daemon (LCD)** is an HTTP1.1 server exposed by the Cosmos SDK, and its default port is `1317` [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/good-to-know-dev-terms-developer-portal-18be10ae1b2#76fc156d-22a5-49f5-ad33-603b3e6829a5)

		- > daemon? [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/good-to-know-dev-terms-developer-portal-18be10ae1b2#9c43ef99-8852-47ed-8621-0118fe56bdc7) 
		  
		  note:: Before SDK v0.40, to get a REST API it was necessary to run another backend service (or daemon (opens new window), a term inherited from Unix), for example using gaiacli rest-server --laddr 0.0.0.0:1317 --node localhost:26657. In Cosmos SDK v0.40, REST was moved inside the node service making it part of the Cosmos SDK, but the term "daemon" stuck, leading to the name light client daemon (LCD).
		- > A **remote procedure call (RPC)** is _a software communication protocol_. The term is often found in distributed computing because RPC is a technique to realize inter-process communication (IPC) by allowing a program to cause a subroutine procedure that is executed in a different address space (a different machine). [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/good-to-know-dev-terms-developer-portal-18be10ae1b2#97d78e48-1be4-4770-a85e-b499000f2fe8)
		- > RPC can be understood as a client-server interaction in which the "caller" is the client, more specifically the requesting program, and the "executor" is the server, more specifically the service-providing program. The interaction is implemented through a request-response message-passing system. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/good-to-know-dev-terms-developer-portal-18be10ae1b2#e620597d-c9a8-4e1d-8e1f-d4af4d696665)
		- > RPC allows calling functions in different address spaces. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/good-to-know-dev-terms-developer-portal-18be10ae1b2#20c1f91f-71dd-481b-99a3-f123612ce657)
		- > However, with [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/good-to-know-dev-terms-developer-portal-18be10ae1b2#f8cfd87d-427c-43ec-9a76-8e64afbab633)
		- > However, with RPC, the developer codes as if the subroutine would be local; the developer does not have to code in details for remote interaction. Thus, with RPCs it is implied that all calling procedures are basically the same, independent of them being local or remote calls. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/good-to-know-dev-terms-developer-portal-18be10ae1b2#e02a5496-abf5-4d30-8c37-0a586e91bc29)
		- > The client has a stub that interfaces with the remote procedure, while the server has a stub to interface with the original request procedure. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/good-to-know-dev-terms-developer-portal-18be10ae1b2#eb4bdb48-c75d-4f94-84ff-b28071dbdefc)
		- > client calls a client stub - a piece of code converting parameters that are passed between client and servers during an RPC. The call is a local procedure call. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/good-to-know-dev-terms-developer-portal-18be10ae1b2#39b3c3d7-0f15-46f9-8b36-26d8fea761e4)
		- > The server also has a stub to interface with the remote procedure.
		  > 
		  1. The client stub packs the procedure parameters into a message. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/good-to-know-dev-terms-developer-portal-18be10ae1b2#f9f5e907-651e-4e63-8ac9-c4a3a0e5e0cd)
		- > Packing procedure parameters is called **marshaling**. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/good-to-know-dev-terms-developer-portal-18be10ae1b2#7f587fb5-b4f3-4a0a-b434-8880db1d9c09)
		- > 1. The client stub then makes a system call to send the message.
		  2. The client's local operating system (OS) sends the message from the client (machine A) to the server (machine B) through the corresponding transport layers.
		  3. The server OS passes the incoming packets to the server stub.
		  4. The server stub unpacks the message and with it the included procedure parameters - this is called **unmarshaling**.
		  5. The server stub calls a server procedure and the procedure is executed.
		  6. Once the procedure is finalized, the output is returned to the server stub.
		  7. The server stub packs the return values into a message.
		  8. The message is sent to the transport layer, which sends the message to the client's transport layer.
		  9. The client stub unmarshals the return parameters and returns them to the original calling client.

		- > The Interchain Stack exposes both the CometBFT RPC and the LCD. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/good-to-know-dev-terms-developer-portal-18be10ae1b2#88136f01-206b-445b-8866-4c0476608577)
		- > For each gRPC endpoint defined in a Protobuf `Query` service, the Cosmos SDK offers a corresponding REST endpoint. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/good-to-know-dev-terms-developer-portal-18be10ae1b2#8f611351-4ccb-42ec-ae16-64dfcb51f9a9)
		- > **gRPC-gateway** is a tool to expose gRPC endpoints as REST endpoints. It helps provide APIs in gRPC and RESTful style, reads gRPC service definitions, and generates reverse-proxy servers that can translate a RESTful JSON API into gRPC.
