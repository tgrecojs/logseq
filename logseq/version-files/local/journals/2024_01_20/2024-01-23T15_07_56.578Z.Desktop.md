  ### [05:57] The Functions of Cognitive Bypassing

  ### ‚ú® Summary
  The functions of cognitive bypassing include: 1) avoiding or preventing the experience of painful emotions or material, 2) maintaining a fragile psychological structure by avoiding disorganization and change, and 3) for individuals who struggle to experience emotions, using cognitive description as the only option to communicate their experiences.

  <blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>So, really, to be able to reflect on it, it's really, really important. Why am I thinking this? Why am I saying that? Why am I getting so mad about this? Why do I just not want to talk about that? You know, what's the function that's heard? So usually it's about avoiding painful material or you think it will be painful. That's one. I think another thing that people are motivated around the function it serves is to prevent a kind of disorganization of often a loosely held together psychological structure with Bubble gum and bailing wire. Now, it feels very rickety, very precarious, very infraigial. So cognitive bypassing is kind of a way to just keep it the way it is. You know, can't we all just be nice? Something like that. Those are two big functions that I've seen. Training pain, understandably, and avoiding change.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>To name a third one here that I think is probably useful for the kind of people who might have seen this episode title pop up in your podcast, Search Bar or YouTube, Search Bar or whatever And go, oh, that sounds interesting to me. There are a lot of people who have a really hard time experiencing emotions broadly. And this can be either the experience of emotionality as a kind of theoretical construct almost or the physical sensation of it in the body. And they're really cut off from that experience for one reason or another. And we might get into some of the reasons during this episode. But for people who fall into that category, the only option that a person might feel is available to them is describing something cognitively. Yeah. I was talking with Stephanie Fu pretty recently. She's the author of What My Bones Know, which is about complex PTSD and her personal history. And one of the things that she reported is basically she gets asked a lot, well, how did it feel to have this thing happen to you? Or how did it feel to have your mother talk to you that way or do that thing to you? And her report to loosely paraphrase here, hopefully accurately, is basically that it probably felt really bad, but I don't have a feeling of it in the moment. And I have this kind of sense of separation from that feeling, which is a form of disassociation. So for somebody who really can't speak to how they felt about something, they're only really option is to report it to you. So that's kind of another third category of people who might end up cognitively bypassing a lot.</blockquote>

  ### ‚ú® Summary
  The discussion focuses on the significance of how we spend our free time and emphasizes the impact of distractions on the overall quality of life. It introduces the concept of slow distractions versus fast distractions, explaining that fast distractions merely play on surface-level reactions without engaging the brain's full capacity. The intention is to make a case for slow distractions being more beneficial for free time and to provide insights on rewiring the brain to prefer slow distractions.

  <blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>All right. So in today's deep dive, I want to start by noting that this is the type, the time of year rather, where there is a lot of discussion about how to be more productive, whether that be in our Professional lives or in terms of our leisure. Today, I want to talk about something different. I want to talk about what we do with our time when we are not trying to be productive, when we are seeking distraction in that downtime in between more serious activities, when we're done With work and exercising and building that canoe out in the garage. What do we do? Now, our temptation in such situations is to seek the most compelling possible distraction in the moment, something that almost always will be delivered to us through a screen. But the distractions that we fill this free time with actually do matter, not in a sense of productivity or creativity, but in the sense of the overall quality of your life. So here's what I want to do in today's deep dive. I'm going to introduce the idea of slow distractions versus fast distractions. I'm then going to explain why slow distractions are a better way to spend your free time than their fast counterpart. And then I will talk about how to specifically rewire your brain to prefer slow distractions. So let's start by trying to be clear about what do we mean by a slow versus fast distraction, a slow distraction, a fast distraction rather, it plays on our fundamental interest and attractions As a human being. But it just surfaces. It just surfs rather on the surfaces of these reactions, never really requiring you to load up your brain in its full capacity, never really requiring you to actually interrogate or Interact with yourself or your world or your understanding of the world. I want to give you some examples here of fast distractions that just play with and surf on the surface of our human instincts. And then I'll contrast them to slow distractions that would play on those in a deeper way. So I'm going to with great trepidation, do some illustration here. So for those who are watching, just have just listing, I'm going to load up on the screen. You'll see two columns, fast and slow. So we can sort of illustrate what we're talking about.</blockquote>

  1. Betting and speculative markets, like stocks or commodities, allow individuals to buy and sell assets and speculate on price changes.
  2. Creating markets on purpose has become a popular method for obtaining answers to specific questions.
  3. Betting markets can be utilized to assess the probability of achieving a goal or meeting a deadline.
  4. Through anonymous betting in a simple market, a consensus estimate can be formed.
  5. The act of buying and selling in a market leads to a general agreement on the likelihood of an event.

  ### ‚ú® Summary
  Betting and speculative markets are like stocks or commodities where you can buy and sell and make cash based on price changes. In the past, such markets were mainly a byproduct of other markets, but now people deliberately create them to answer questions. For example, if you want to know if a project will meet its deadline, instead of having ineffective meetings, you can have a betting market where people can anonymously bet on the outcome. The price of an asset in the market represents the probability of meeting the deadline. By buying or selling, people create a consensus estimate.

  <blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>They're still game-changing.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>So a betting market or a speculative market is like stocks or commodities or currency futures. It's a place where there's something that you can buy and sell and you can speculate. So if you buy today and sell tomorrow and the price goes up during these two days, then you can walk away with cash. And if you sell today and buy tomorrow, you also walk away with cash. So speculative market's been around for a long time. And they've mostly been there as a side effect of people wanting to have markets for other things. But in the last few decades, people have thought more about making markets on purpose because that you want to know the answer to a question. So say if you have a company or a project and it has a deadline, you might want to know, will we make the deadline? And one way to do that, of course, is to have meetings and have everybody say whether they think you're going to make the deadline, and that often doesn't go very well. And so another approach is to have a simple betting market where people can bet on whether you make the deadline. They can bet anonymously. And so there's say maybe an asset that pays $10 if you make the deadline and if the going price is $3 for it, then that represents roughly a 30% chance of making the deadline. And if you think the probability is higher than 30%, then you could buy. If you think it's lower, you could sell. The net effect of people buying and selling is to create a consensus estimate</blockquote>

  > In this episode, I discuss how to build and apply a growth mindset ‚Äî the practice of self-rewarding and focusing on learning and skill development through effort ‚Äî to improve learning and performance. I also discuss how our internal narratives drive our ability to make progress. I contrast the growth mindset vs. the fixed mindset and describe how the type of feedback or praise we receive shapes our mindsets, and the huge advantage of rewarding and celebrating ‚Äúverbs‚Äù (actions) rather than adjectives (performance labels). I also discuss data showing how stress can enhance performance and explain why the growth mindset works synergistically with the ‚Äústress-is-enhancing mindset,‚Äù and how to combine them. Whether you are a student, coach, therapist, parent, teacher or simply someone seeking to improve at something, this episode provides numerous science-supported tools for how to adopt a performance enhancing mindset.<br/>>  For the full show notes, visit  hubermanlab.com .<br/>>  Thank you to our sponsors  AG1:  https://drinkag1.com/huberman <br/>>  Eight Sleep:  https://eightsleep.com/huberman <br/>>  ROKA:  https://roka.com/huberman <br/>>  InsideTracker:  https://insidetracker.com/huberman <br/>>  Supplements from Momentous   https://www.livemomentous.com/huberman <br/>>  Timestamps  (00:00:00) Growth Mindset<br/>>  (00:02:55) Sponsors: Eight Sleep   Effort & Verbs<br/>>  (00:34:36) Sponsor: AG1<br/>>  (00:35:41) Tool: Timing, Intelligence vs. Effort Praise & Performance<br/>>  (00:40:080 Fixed Mindset vs. Growth Mindset: Failure & Performance<br/>>  (00:50:28) Tool: Shift from Fixed Mindset<br/>>  (00:54:23) Sponsor: InsideTracker<br/>>  (00:55:30) Stress-is-Enhancing Mindset<br/>>  (01:05:53) How Stress Can Enhance Performance¬†<br/>>  (01:13:21) Growth Mindset   Stress-is-Enhancing Mindset & Performance<br/>>  (01:20:36) Reframing Stress<br/>>  (01:25:45) Tool 1: Student & Teacher Mindset<br/>>  (01:28:17) Tool 2: Effort Praise/Feedback: Verbs not Labels<br/>>  (01:31:24) Tool 3: Errors & Seeking Help<br/>>  (01:32:58) Tool 4: Self-Teaching & Growth Mindset<br/>>  (01:34:35) Tool 5: Reframe ‚ÄúMind is Like a Muscle‚Äù Analogy<br/>>  (01:39:20) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter<br/>>  Title Card Photo Credit:  Mike Blabac <br/>>   Disclaimer
