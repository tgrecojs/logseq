		- ### setting tgrecojs_akash_... key
		- **FAILING RESTART** - values in akashrc are incorrect
		- Update address variable to use provider services cli
		- ### adding key with provider services
		- provide services add $keyname

			- Setting os inside our rc file has made this the default and as you'll soon see this is pretty useful. **among the info produced via the add command  is the mnemonic associated with this wallet.
			- **you can take this and pop it into keplr, leap, or whatever you wallet of choice is**
