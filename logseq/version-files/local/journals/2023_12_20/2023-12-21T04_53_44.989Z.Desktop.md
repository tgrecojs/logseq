		- ### Merkle Tree Formula #Math
			- #### Sigma Notation a.k.a. Big “E” sign
				- Sigma notation is a concise way of specifying that you are summing up a set of terms
				- Below sigma, `i`, you find the starting index.
				- Above sigma, you find the ending value (not applicable)

				- The formula suggests that you're taking the sum of `hash(node.children(i).hash)` for all values of i within a specified range.
		- ## Binary Tree
			- A merkle tree can only have one sibling.
			- We can use that sibling to
			- ## hash + concat

	- TODO Get an understanding of how the proof relates to verification.
