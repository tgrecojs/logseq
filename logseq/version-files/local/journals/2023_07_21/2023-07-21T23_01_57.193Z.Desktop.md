- ### IPFS x UCAN x Endo
	- IPFS gateways are becoming big business.
	- Since getting involved with Endo,
	- In order for applications to use IPFS they need to use a gateway in order to access CIDs. But what if everything was local. What if you could create a Merkle DAG that stored user's conversations locally on their machine (could be given access to a "save" button that downloads this).
	- Every time you interact in a chat, a new node is created.

	- ### Kris' legendary hat
		- **NOT the sorting hat**
		- Comfortability - Imposter syndrome makes you (incorrectly) perceive that you don't belong... that you're out of place. The hat acts a guarantor for being out of place :).
		- If he takes it off he is invisible though because *we all look alike*.

	- ### Issues with how we hire.
		- We might find ourselves in a scenario where we end up hiring a broom ðŸ§¹.
		- We might find a way to effectively hire more broom! And then end up with a team..!...... th-..that's .... made up of brooms ðŸ§¹
	- ### The secret sauce
		- > **Hire not for culture fit, but for culture add!**
	- ## Design Patterns that should not be named
		- What they have in common - **they nest**
			- Promises
			- Parsers
			- State machines
		- ## LOL

	- ### What we're doing
		- Functions that return things. Functions that return callbacks also return things!
